"Well folks, here is the reality: If you are voting for these policies and want them, there should be a federal tax option where you check the box and agree to pay a higher tax rate for these policies. Let us normal folks live in peace.

These migrants are getting more in aid than what most NY'ers are making. They are getting free shelter, transportation cards, food stamps, education, medical care, legal services, etc., Do the math... let's assume a hotel is charging $100 per night (very conservative amount) stay to these migrants. That $3k per month. That's how much you're probably paying for rent except you're working 50 hour weeks and then have to pay taxes so that these migrants can get these benefits for free. How is this fair? How is it fair that our tax dollars, designed to go to other legal citizens, are being used to pay for migrants and their children's educational/medical expenses? How is it fair that these migrants are getting $250 per month, per individual, in food stamps? Meanwhile, most New Yorkers have to remove items from their shopping carts because they have to balance their own budget?

Here is Joe Biden encouraging illegals to surge the border in a debate:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYwLYMPLYbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYwLYMPLYbo)

With this type of language, imagine living in these countries and hearing a U.S. president say those words... ""Wow, the U.S. president is telling us to come to America"" is the only reaction you will get from that.

It's obvious why Democrats want illegals... they increase the amount of electoral votes so in the presidential election, states with more illegal immigrants will increase the amount of votes for Democrats. Also, do you think the children of illegals born in America are more likely to vote Democrat or Republican? Gee, vote for the party who allowed your parents to illegally come to America or the party that wants to prevent them? Tough choice. 

In fact, Chuck Schumer is on record stating that illegals should be legal citizens and vote. So he wants tens of millions of illegals to be allowed to vote in presidential elections. Don't believe me? Here he is publicly admitting that illegals should be legal. Chuck Schumer is one of the most powerful Democrat members. Does this sound like someone who wants to stop illegal immigration? 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrJWVnVu8PY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrJWVnVu8PY)

Just look at these two charts... This is public data released by the border patrol. Decide for yourselves who the Democrats care about more: Do they care more about winning elections or helping YOU?

Here is the amount of migrants allowed under Biden. Under Trump, you saw record lows because his policy in immigration was simple: We want qualified migrants who will benefit out society, not a flood of people coming in who are looking to take advantage of our favorable benefits.

Here is a chart of illegal immigration encounters in the border under Trump and Biden...

Notice, as soon as Biden became president, it has skyrocketed? Why? Because Biden ran on letting illegal immigrants come to America... he told them to. This was not a mistake. This was Democrats trying to secure the victory of future elections by bringing in people who will help them win elections in the future.

Just ask yourself... why did Biden sue Texas to have them remove barbed wire from the border that Texas put up to prevent illegal immigration?

Democrats wanted funding for Ukraine. Republicans wanted funding for the border.

The issue is Democrats knew that the border issue is already a lost cause. So they packaged these two things together under the same package. Republicans don't want to fund Ukraine forever so they were naturally against it. Democrats then used this as an excuse to attack Republicans saying they didn't want the border bill despite the fact that MOST of the money was going to Ukraine.

Also, read the border bill. It's horrendous. Also, read the fact that Biden admitted he could use executive action to institute the very same policies he tried to get passed in Congress.

Also, why would Republicans help Democrats, in election year, when Democrats caused all this damage already? Why didn't Democrats do this in 2021, 2022, or 2023? Conveniently, they want a border bill done in 2024 when their polls are getting destroyed in immigration?",1723660441.0

Trump had ordered inventory to finish 200 miles of border wall. Biden sold off the inventory and refused to finish that section of the wall.

Biden has fought New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas for trying to defend their own borders saying that it was a federal issue and states cannot interfere.

Kamala Harris, who was put in charge of figuring out why illegal immigration and asylum cases were flooded, did not go to the border once other than to an area that was heavily protected.

That has nothing to do with if they have grounds for refugee status once they come here.

¬†They shouldn't get to cross seven borders to cherry-pick the best place for refuge - whether that's the US or Switzerland or Norway or Germany.

If you have a problem with it then vote for a US government that does not destabilize the countries they come from. That would be the rational solution. Not complaining that they cross a bunch of borders. Additionally you should probably consider just which countries they cross and who has what responsibility.

The way I see it if the US does this to Venezuela for example then it should accept the refugees from there. Same as from Cuba. That would be the moral thing to do.

You are right of course that the US saw a risk in socialism and still does. But the risk is not national security, it is about money.

In addition to that they do not want socialism if it makes it harder for US corporations to profit from natural resources in those countries.

But you are right here. The data is less severe than I thought. But even democrat super PACs like factcheck.org estimate 4.2 million by October 2023. 

Title 42 ended in 2023


> Comprehensive figures are available through October. So to keep things as simple as possible, we‚Äôll present numbers for February 2021, the month after Biden took office, through October, unless otherwise noted.

> The DHS data show 6.5 million encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border in that time frame, a figure that includes both the 5.8 million apprehensions between legal ports of entry ‚Äì the number typically used for illegal immigration ‚Äì and a little more than 700,000 migrants who arrived at ports of entry without authorization to enter the U.S.

> Of those 6.5 million encounters by CBP, 2.5 million people have been released into the U.S. with notices to appear in immigration court or report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the future, or other classifications, such as parole.

> There are certainly others who have crossed the border by evading the authorities. DHS¬†estimated¬†there were 660,000 ‚Äúgotaways,‚Äù or unlawful entries, in fiscal 2021. The agency would not provide an updated estimate. However, a DHS spokesperson told us: ‚ÄúUnder this Administration, the estimated annual apprehension rate has averaged 78%, identical to the rate of the prior Administration.‚Äù That rate would support a gotaway figure of 1.6 million from February 2021 through October.

> The 1.6 million figure would bring the number of those entering or released into the country to about 4.2 million.

That leaves 7 months of illegals coming in with title 42 no longer in place. 

So, that would leave us with around 6 million illegals during biden's term, which obviously doesn't include people that evaded detection by border patrol.

It‚Äôs not as simple as migrant=good US=bad but consider this: migrants know that they‚Äôve got a very good chance of being ripped off or killed on the journey to the border and of being jailed once they cross it.

‚ÄòWhat are you doing to help?‚Äô: Mayor Adams urges New Yorkers to ask themselves ‚Äî not him ‚Äî how to fix NYC migrant crisis

By Chris Sommerfeldt and Michael Gartland
New York Daily News
Published: Aug 08, 2023 at 5:20 pm

Mayor Adams suggested Tuesday that the city‚Äôs migrant crisis is getting so out of hand that New Yorkers should stop asking him to solely address it ‚Äî and instead consider what they can do to help.

‚ÄúThis is a moment where people need to stop asking, ‚ÄòEric, what are you doing?‚Äô This is a moment we need to ask, ‚ÄòWhat are we doing?‚Äô‚Äù the mayor said during an unrelated press conference in the Bronx.

The mayor issued the sweeping call for everyday New Yorkers to get more involved after being asked if he plans to hire more Spanish-speaking teachers to help educate newly-arrived Latin American migrant children.

After saying the city may be too cash-strapped to make such hires, Adams added: ‚ÄúThis is not Mayor Adams‚Äô job. This is the job of the people of the City of New York, and everyone should participate in that ... I‚Äôm not going to allow anyone to allow this moment to go past without asking: ‚ÄòWhat are you doing to help people who are in need right now?‚Äô‚Äù

Adams‚Äô latest comments come as the city continues to shelter, feed and provide services for more than 57,000 migrants to the tune of millions of dollars every week.

The Adams administration estimates the city is on track to spend more than $4 billion on the crisis by next summer, blowing a hole in the municipal budget that the mayor said justifies his call for more volunteerism.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre dealing with a real economic challenge here,‚Äù he said before commending NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Community Affairs Mark Stewart for recently launching an educational program to help Spanish speakers improve their English.

Some of Adams‚Äô left-wing critics ridiculed him on social media for imploring constituents to pick up the slack.


‚ÄúAsk not what Mayor Adams can do for you, ask what you can do for Mayor Adams,‚Äù Tony Melone, a spokesman for New Kings Democrats, a grassroots progressive group in Brooklyn, wrote on Twitter in reference to Adams‚Äô comments.

In addition to calling on New Yorkers to do more to help, Adams has for months pleaded with President Biden to allocate more migrant crisis-related federal monetary aid and resources for the city.


Adams found some support on that front Tuesday from New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a progressive Democrat who is ideologically opposed to the mayor.

Bowman, who attended the same press conference as the mayor in the Bronx, told reporters afterward that Adams is right in calling on Biden to do more.

‚ÄúThis is an administrative response. It doesn‚Äôt have to go through Congress. We don‚Äôt need legislation,‚Äù Bowman said. ‚ÄúWe need executive action from the president.‚Äù

The congressman added that recent conversations with officials in the Biden administration have been ‚Äúfruitful,‚Äù adding that the president‚Äôs team is planning to send a liaison to the Adams administration asylum seeker intake center at Manhattan‚Äôs Roosevelt Hotel in coming days.

‚ÄúBut we need action,‚Äù Bowman added. ‚ÄúWe need the president to take a leadership role because here‚Äôs the thing: Democrats are looking bad right now in New York State, and that‚Äôs unacceptable when we have to win at least four congressional seats to take back the House. So hopefully the president is listening.‚Äù

The city‚Äôs migrant crisis reached a turning point last weekend when dozens of migrants resorted to sleeping on the sidewalk outside the Roosevelt after being informed there was no more room in the city shelter system, whose population is at an all-time high.

Amid the unprecedented overcrowding, Adams‚Äô administration plans to open a mega tent-style shelter on Randalls Island in the coming weeks with capacity for 2,000 migrants. On Tuesday afternoon, city workers could be seen making preparations to set up the shelter spanning four soccer fields on the island‚Äôs southern tip.",1691548939.0

Then the people elected Rudy who cleaned the city up from bottom to top with his policies. Then Bloomberg who really was a Democrat but ran on the Republican ticket but knew how to run a city as well. Then while things are running along well we decide to elect Bill de Blasio who had no idea what he was doing and yet we re-elected him again because its what we do.

"Look I dislike Mayor Adams, but this headline is clickbait and every single person in this thread just fell for reading just the one sound bite completely out of context.

I just watched the press conference. It was at press conference unveiling the Kingsbridge Armory where the Mayor, the Governor, and other New York officials did a long Q&A afterwards. The majority of the questions from the media were about the migrant crisis in NY/NYC and he fielded all of them very well.

Adams says in response to an inaudible question 
> ‚ÄúThis is a moment where people need to stop asking ‚ÄòEric, what are you doing?‚Äô, this is a moment we need to ask ‚ÄòWhat are WE doing?‚Äô. 

He continues with:

> ‚ÄúIf you speak Spanish, there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from opening a class to teach migrants in Spanish in one of the HURCS. We will fire you the room to do so. We cannot do this alone. This is an all hands on deck. The dollars that are coming in are not equalling to the dollars that we have to pay going out. So we‚Äôre going to do our part to the best of our ability within the financial constraints, but we have a real call. We need every New Yorker who has something to offer to play a role. This is not ‚ÄúMayor Adams‚Äô job‚Äù. This is a job of the people of the city of New York. And everyone should participate. Through New York City Cares, through the hundred non-profits that we are a part of, through all the other groups. Everyone needs to be a part of that. And I‚Äôm not going to allow anyone to let this moment to go pass without asking ‚ÄòWhat are you doing to help people who are in need right now‚Äô‚Äù. 

**Folks. It is a call to action. This response is after he spends 20 minutes highlighting the efforts made on the borough, city, county, and state levels to combat a growing migrant crisis. He commends the Governor and all of the city officials who have stepped up and participated. He is now asking for citizens to do their duty as citizens and neighbors to volunteer, donate, teach, and participate in solving an issue that is out of control and impacting everyone.**

‚Äú1968, also saw a three-day Broadway strike and a nine-day sanitation strike.[20] Quality of life in the city reached a nadir during the sanitation strike as mounds of garbage caught fire and strong winds blew the filth through the streets.[21] In June 1968, the New York City Police Department deployed snipers to protect Lindsay during a public ceremony, shortly after they detained a knife-wielding man who had demanded to meet the mayor.[22] With the schools shut down, police engaged in a slowdown, firefighters threatening job actions, the city awash in garbage, and racial and religious tensions breaking to the surface, Lindsay later called the last six months of 1968 ""the worst of my public life.""[1]

I will just state flat out: I do not believe, for one second, that all of these people have a jailed spouse or parent killed by their government. I think that's bs.

The NYC government should be SOOOOO much wealthier than it is, because people should not be able to have the absurd amounts of wealth that they do here. It should be taxed.

That‚Äôs a great question, and I think putting our resources towards shoring up the economic and social well-being of all countries in Latin America should be the crux of our immigration policy.

Biden did the right thing by trying to go through congress first. Congressional republicans were negligent in their duties by refusing to vote on it because they didn‚Äôt want the problem to be solved and wanted it to be an election issue.

Also, the enforcement mechanisms in the bill which Biden claimed he couldn't do via executive action ended up becoming things he did via executive action.

>Maybe he could‚Äôve been more aggressive, but damned if he was always too centralist and not up with the times to keep trying to do the bipartisan thing.

My bigger issue is that the White House lied for two years straight and claimed the border was ""secure"" when their own CBP data showed multiple historic levels of border encounters and crossings.

NYC was getting thousands of migrants per week in 2022. Texas was getting tens of thousands per sector per week. Yet the White House opted to gaslight Americans and claim this was normal.

>His administration was promptly sued and the cases are making their way through the courts.

This White House has a well-documented history of ramming through clearly unconstitutional edicts via EO, so fear of litigation was clearly not why Biden didn't pursue any immigration enforcement EOs.

The White House spent 2021, 2023, and most of 2023 claiming the border was 'secure'. Their opinion, and priorities, only changed when the polling showed it was going to cost them the election (and it did).

>Instead of doing that, Biden went to congress first.

Again, the immigration bill in the Senate wasn't negotiated until fall 2023, right before the 2024 election season began.

Biden waited literally years before trying to get a bipartisan deal done, after his administration had allowed millions of migrants into the country and turned it into a top 3 kitchen table issue.

>Trump wanted to run on immigration, so despite the Democrats agreeing to legislation many are ideologically opposed to in exchange for funding for Ukraine and Israel, the bill was rejected by Republicans at the last minute and Biden signed the EO.

The bill also had bipartisan opposition both times it was up for a vote, and the second time it was rejected by two of its own co-sponsors. You can blame Trump all you want, but he's not the one who caused the migrant crisis from 2021-2023. That's on Biden and his day-one policies.

Very weird that the same people who blame Trump for ""killing"" the border bill also refuse to blame Biden Admin's terrible border policies for the current migrant crisis. 

Maybe if Biden had prioritized a bipartisan immigration bill during his first year when he actually had some political capital, it would have passed.

Instead his Admin. repeatedly lied to the American people about the border being ""secure"" and pushed disastrous policies which buried his own party and directly contributed to a [Venezuelan prison gang](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/nyregion/a-venezuelan-gang-reaches-new-york.html) gaining foothold in the U.S.

of course, i do not want anyone to starve/get sick and I know most are looking for something better, but its coming at OUR expense

I have a  high amount of money taken away in taxes every paycheck, but now I hear we are losing all sorts of services to make room for the migrants (school space, recreation, we're competing for medical services). If the migrants get cash jobs while getting all these free social benefits, then they potentially OUTEARN average Americans with more disposable income and create price inflation for people like me who pay taxes.

for example - at my job, I receive health insurance, however, I pay $1,000 for a family plan. then I pay a co-visit fee, and have to meet a deductible on top of all the taxes i pay. Migrants walks into the same doctor's office and pays ZERO. how is that fair? 

You are exactly right about preventive care - which should be to close the border as I mention above, and stop providing all these social benefits, then the flow of migrants will STOP.

Funny thing is that people said the same about your parents. 

Stop pretending like everyone using any sort of welfare ‚Äúgames the system‚Äù. It‚Äôs an ignorant concept of welfare. 

Stop pretending like every migrant here plans on ‚Äúabusing the system‚Äù and ‚Äúfeel entitled to everything‚Äù. You seem to already be Portraying them as long term burdens who demand free things. 

That‚Äôs exactly how others viewed your parents.

My point is, regardless of ‚Äúclosing the borders‚Äù or ‚Äúbuilding a wall‚Äù, that doesn‚Äôt stop migration. 

My point is that attempts to mass deport has failed, and pretending like ‚Äúshutting down the border‚Äù prevents someone from crossing the border is as asinine as believing they‚Äôd automatically ‚Äúfeel entitled for welfare‚Äù due to their legal status, as if all of the migrants are just lazy leeches.

He signed EOs regarding right-to-shelter regulations and then went to court to ask for the ability to enforce them.

Migrants coming to NYC and not applying for asylum has been covered both by the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/03/nyregion/migrants-asylum-nyc.html) (July) and [NYDN](https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/05/31/very-few-of-nycs-70000-migrants-have-applied-for-asylum-city-official/) (May).

"The migration policy is doing exactly that. A high undocumented migration caused by poor border controls deflates wages, and causes a ""2 speed"" economy of cash-in-hand for the undocumented, and by-the-book for those with work rights. You know the country isn't building enough housing - and hasn't for a decade. The high migration levels are causing property prices to inflate. You can see it here in NY - rents are at an all time high, the city is full, and there is a non-stop stream of migrants.

Weather by intent, or because they are naive or incompetent is kinda irrelevant. I'm past wondering why these neo-liberal, socially left but economically-right parties choose this course of action and assume ill intent at this point.

America's nativist population fertility rate is below replacement. If the border was properly closed and controlled - the population starts dropping, wages inflate, and house prices come down.

In UK/Australia it's a few years before that point - but give it time.

The rise of AfD and other far right parties in Europe is a sure sign of discontent with the neo-lib policies.

For one the processing times are extremely long (between 1 and 2 years when you apply for a green card, for example), which means that some people who would be eligible for a work permit, a visa, or a green card have to uselessly wait for a very long time.

Second, the number of allocated green cards and work visas is fixed (by law) and never changes (because there is no political consensus on that). 

Which means, that it's still the same number of visas for each category every year, irrespective if the US population has grown by X % in the past 30 years.

That also means that we're giving out the same number of work visas whether the economy is doing well and there's lots of job vacancies or whether the economy is in shambles and there's lots of unemployment.

Gotham‚Äôs budget might be late, with City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams warning last week that she and Mayor Adams (no relation) will miss this Sunday‚Äôs fiscal-year deadline.

But the timing of the budget is less important than the substance.

The council and the mayor are arguing over tidbits while missing the big chunk of spending obscuring New York‚Äôs future: How much can we realistically spend on migrants

In his budget proposal, the mayor has finally admitted to reality ‚Äî the migrant ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù is here to stay.

This is a reality that he helped create, by continuing to offer all migrants, including single young men with no credible claims to political asylum, at least 30 to 60 days of city-paid shelter.

And the city is now institutionalizing this ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù as a permanent part of city government.

Last Tuesday, the mayor announced that the city will no longer rely on so many ‚Äúemergency‚Äù no-bid contracts, instead starting a competitive-bid process for vendors interested in managing migrant hotels and shelters as well as providing other migrant services.

Tellingly, this process is going to be ‚Äúopen-ended‚Äù with no deadlines, the city‚Äôs bid documents state.

As migrants continue to flock to New York, the city will keep opening shelters for them.

The city will sign contracts with various vendors for at least a year apiece, and ‚Äúpossibly additional sites‚Äù will be added to the city‚Äôs hundreds of migrant shelters.

And the services the city will ask these contractors to provide are comprehensive.

Under its voluntary ‚Äúright to shelter‚Äù pledge, the city has in court committed itself to providing people with shelter and food.

Yet we‚Äôve been adding services over the past two years that are gradually becoming a default.

There‚Äôs ‚Äúcase management‚Äù: At every shelter, the vendor must ‚Äúassess the specific needs of each individual including progress and barriers towards exiting shelter.‚Äù

There‚Äôs ‚Äúchildcare plan making.‚Äù

There‚Äôs laundry ‚Äî not just washing sheets and towels in bulk, as hotels do, but personal, bagged pick-up-and-delivery laundry.

Between project managers, case managers, security guards, food servers and laundry providers, New York City is building up a mini-economy of thousands of contract workers and hundreds of vendors, all of whom depend on this ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù persisting.

Not to mention all the owners of B- and C-grade hotels and vacant office space, happy to have a long-term customer.

And now, the city will ask vendors to provide 30% of their subcontracts to minority- and women-owned businesses, creating a broader constituency in favor of a permanent migrant ‚Äúcrisis.‚Äù

As we enter this ‚Äúnext phase,‚Äù as the city puts it, spending on migrants is already rising to $4.7 billion annually for the 2025 fiscal year that starts Monday, up $1 billion from the current year.

The city expects the amount to fall to $4 billion in 2026, to $3 billion in 2027, and then zeroes out future spending altogether.

But on what realistic basis is this spending going to vanish?

The city is going to ask an army of contractors to locate and procure new hotels and office space, collectively hire thousands of contract workers, and then just . . . shut it down?

No, New York is creating a permanent, expensive new entitlement program.

It‚Äôs also taking pressure off the Biden administration, which should be identifying people eligible for refugee resettlement before they cross the border and sharply curtailing the admittance of people spuriously claiming ‚Äúasylum.‚Äù

A permanent new program costing billions of dollars annually has huge implications for the city budget, which, under Adams‚Äô proposal, will top out at $114.1 billion next year.

Migrant spending of $4.7 billion for the upcoming year is 14% of the salaries and wages the city pays to its total workforce ‚Äî so if it persists, New York will face severe cutbacks in the regular day-to-day services it provides.

But the council isn‚Äôt questioning this big picture, instead quibbling over crumbs.

Should the city add back funding for Sunday library hours? Should it restore CUNY funding? Funding for sufficient building inspectors?

Sure, it probably should, but these things cost, collectively, tens of millions of dollars, not billions.

Last week, Speaker Adams compared the budget negotiations to landing a plane after spending some time in a holding pattern and going through a ‚Äúdiversion.‚Äù

"This is what happens when you turn basic policy imperatives into hardline partisan wedge issues, and both Republican and Democratic leadership are to blame. Our immigration system is broken and needs to be addressed. But what was once a problem acknowledged by both parties, albeit with disagreement over the methods to address the issue, has become a purity test devoid of any practicality or pragmatism, where individual states and localities seek to punish each other for their divergent stances on the issue.

Right to shelter was never intended to address an immigration crisis that is really a federal issue, not a local one, and this administrations extension of that policy to address this particular crisis is incredibly misguided. 

By the late 90s/early 2000s, it was clear what needed to be done to address this problem and you had at least some people from either side of the aisle working towards the only practical solution‚Äîmake it easier for people to immigrate to the United States *legally* and simplify the process overall so they can work, pay taxes, and contribute to our economy. 

Like so may other contemporary political issues, what makes sense is perpetually set aside in favor of partisan zealotry, and we all suffer more for it.

Edit: It‚Äôs either vilify and demonize and ‚Äúbuild a wall,‚Äù or stick your head in the sand, ignore the problem and hemorrhage tax dollars‚Äîboth approaches are extremely wasteful, negatively impact our society, and fail to actually solve the problem. The simple fact is that no matter what you do, people who want (and *need*) to get here will find a way‚Äîthey always have and they always will. So you can either employ practical solutions that take into account the fact of the matter, or you can play make believe in either political direction at all of our expense.",1719242123.0

Adopting free trade agreement between North, Central & South American countries can: 
Reduced supply chain ( great for environment), higher labour cost offset by reduced transportation cost, better oversight on labour, environment & business practices. 

These countries also have raw material to produce infrastructure for  renewable energy. 

By bringing back our manufacturing we can  reduce military expenditure across the world, increase energy security & plough money from defense budget  back into  flyover states, provide free trade schools.

"Putting aside your specious first argument:

First, asylees and refugees are not ""illegal"" immigrants.  The United States is duty bound by treaties to allow asylees and refugees entry.  Conservatives often collapse undocumented immigrants - those who cross the border or overstay visas - with people who have a legal right to at least make their case to stay in the United States.  I don't take you to mean that we should just try to leave those treaties, but if you did, I'd say America presents itself as a haven for immigrants and we shouldn't make it even harder for people fleeing fucked up situations to enter.  Huddled masses yearning to be free.

Second, ""legal"" immigration to the United States is hard as fuck.  Kudos to your mom for making it here.  Assuming she came post the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), she won the lotto to come here, came here through chain migration, or, possibly, came here legally as an asylee or refugee.  A lot of people often point to their family coming here ""legally"" without an understanding of the explicitly racist immigration laws pre INA.  Some of them were literally called exclusion acts.  My mom came here legally, too, pre-INA.  Guess what?  She came from Europe.

Third, the city's right to shelter has been noted to stave off shit like, well, cleaning shit off the streets like in SF and tent cities in LA.  Given how goddamn cold it gets in winter, even with climate change, people need a place to stay or they'll die.  We also don't want children on the streets, so we?

Finally, the situation is fucked, but the city and state could both be doing more.  A whole lot of empty offices, right?  A lot of red tape stopping new development, including NIMBYs, right?  The answer is more complicated than just converting office space to housing and saying fast track building housing, but it's a start.

The housing issue wouldn't be such a big problem if literally anyone in power would do something about the housing crisis in general. Immigrants aren't causing any new issues, they just exacerbate the systematic failures of our federal, state and local governments.

>Its a slap in the face to legal immigrants like my mom who had to come here legally, pay fees and didn‚Äôt get any free handouts.

Using one persons trials and tribulations to fuck over another group is just shitty behavior. Apply this mentality that one group had it bad so we should treat another group worse is insane if you apply it basically anywhere else.

The reason there are so many people crossing illegally is because our current system is so fucked up and limited that it doesn't work.

When the MTA machines are down in the subway so that nobody can swipe their metrocard do you complain about people jumping the turnstile or do you complain about MTA needing to fix there shit. These people would like to immigrate here legally, they'd be able to get better benefits, jobs, more security, etc, but we have a series of stupid as fuck policies in place that restrict them from any reasonable hope of legal immigration.

I'm not familiar with all the laws regarding undocumented immigrants, but I don't know that it's true that they have ""every right"" to go where they want to go. Like I said, ideally, we would expedite the documentation process. It doesn't make sense to send them across the country before that's complete.

Biden fought to remove the Remain in Mexico policy but was struck down.

The people who cross illegally only claim asylum because they abused the system. If they are going to get deported, they will just not claim asylum and disappear into the country.

Is it a secret that border apprehensions and encounters skyrocketed under Biden's presidency? 

Do you genuinely believe that Biden is serious about stopping this? Eric Adams hasn't even spoken to Biden this entire year despite efforts to do so. Explain how that makes sense. 

You're not serious because you genuinely have no clue how illegal immigration works. These individuals disappear across the country but cross the Southern border. When they get to these Southern states, they enter into local hospitals and use up their services. In Yuma, residents have had difficulties setting up a doctor appointment because the hospitals are treating illegals entering into the country.

"I don't have to google to to support someone elses arguement. That's not how a debate works. You want to make a claim back it up with evidence.   


So now lets get to YOUR claim. Your claim is that:

>housecleaning, painting, renovations, masonry, landscaping in my neighborhood.

has been impacted due to immigration. 

From the intro of the link you provided, emphasis mine:  


>Almost everybody knows that in the past 40 years, the real wages and job prospects for low-skilled men, especially low-skilled minority workers, have fallen. And there is evidence -- **although no consensus** \-- that a rising tide of immigration is partly to blame.

&#x200B;

>The authors are careful to point out that even without increased immigration, **most of the fall in employment and increase in jailed black men would have happened anyway.**

&#x200B;

>**The authors stress that immigration is only one factor in the worsening labor situation** of low-skilled African-American men. ""The 1980-2000 immigrant influx, therefore, generally 'explains' about 20 to 60 percent of the decline in wages, 25 percent of the decline in employment, and about 10 percent of the rise in incarceration rates among blacks with a high school education or less,"" they write.

Sounds a lot like ""low-skilled"" jobs have had pay in decline from the 1980s, while immigration contributes to it, it would have happened anyway. The paper you linked to mentioned that a few times, and seems to be directing more of its focus on drawing the connection to incarceration, which it stops short of saying is conclusive, and leans more towards saying that immigration's impact contributes. So it sounds like wages are declining overall, immigration has an impact, but its not the only cause and would have happened anyway.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor

Operation Condor (Spanish: Operaci√≥n C√≥ndor, also known as Plan C√≥ndor; Portuguese: Opera√ß√£o Condor) was a United States-backed campaign of political repression and state terrorism,[10] involving intelligence operations, CIA-backed coups, as well as assassinations of left-wing and socialist leaders in South America from 1968 to 1989.[11][12] Operation Condor was officially and formally implemented in November 1975 by the right-wing dictatorships of the Southern Cone of South America.[13]

The Guatemalan genocide, also referred to as the Maya genocide,[1] or the Silent Holocaust[3] (Spanish: Genocidio guatemalteco, Genocidio maya, or Holocausto silencioso), was the massacre of Maya civilians during the Guatemalan Civil War (1960‚Äì1996) by successive US-backed Guatemalan military governments.[4] Massacres, forced disappearances, torture and summary executions of guerrillas and especially civilian collaborators at the hands of security forces had been widespread since 1965, and was a longstanding policy of the military regime, which US officials were aware of.[5][6][7] A report from 1984 discussed ""the murder of thousands by a military government that maintains its authority by terror"".[8]",1696205556.0

"The arrogance of the modern human is astounding. There is nothing in the historical record that excludes the trans experience and in many societies they were revered both trans men and women. Humans back then were no less complex, no less gay, no less trans because these things are innate and seen across cultures.

Some fought in wars as men identifying as men. 

Some women were influential. 

It‚Äôs thought that Rome may have a trans emperor even and Egypt as well.

Keep in mind though these individuals existed the discrete idea of trans people as an established phenomenon was known but not flushed out the same way so history often misattributes the trans male experience to something else, but today they‚Äôd certainly just be trans.  

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/how-historians-are-documenting-lives-of-transgender-people#:~:text=Early%20accounts%20of%20trans%20history,Akkadia%2C%20Greece%2C%20and%20Rome.

Hatshepsut (c. 1479‚Äì1458 BC) was one of Egypt‚Äôs most successful pharaohs, ruling Egypt for almost 22 years and ushering in a period of peace and prosperity. No word existed for a female ruler, so she used the male title. She also wore men‚Äôs clothing and a false golden beard, and used both male and female pronouns.

Historians have claimed that Hatshepsut‚Äôs concern for preserving tradition was behind her male presentation, and she reportedly never gave up on feminine displays of jewelry and make-up, but is it possible that her seemingly fluid gender expression is one of the earliest accounts of a trans male life experience?

All too often, the gender identity of historical trans men has been ignorantly or deliberately disregarded‚Äîstolen histories.  Indeed, calculated efforts were made to erase all record of Hatshepsut‚Äôs reign following her death. However, there‚Äôs also the risk of erroneously appropriating Hatshepsut‚Äôs life story by claiming more than 3000 years later that she was trans. The truth is that we‚Äôll never know for certain how Hatshepsut personally identified, but it‚Äôs clear that she went to extraordinary effort to present as a man.",1696255137.0

"I‚Äôm not speculating that, I just posted saying we will never know what they truly identified as deep down. it‚Äôs a single historical example that doesn‚Äôt exclude the dozens of others who lived their whole lives as the opposite gender. 

Furthermore, we often see this with trans men where often times very keen overt actions to change gender identity aren‚Äôt taken seriously.

This has happened in just about every historical period. 

Henri Estienne reported a mid-sixteenth century French FTM who was burned alive for successfully living as a man for many years, with a trade and a wife. These are people who if they lived today would have just been trans and back then who knows what they thought of themselves as. But the clear strain here is that there have always been individuals who have been born one gender and presented as the other. 

‚ÄúA French FTM lived as a man, learned a trade, then married a woman. Soon after, he was exposed by someone from his home town who recognized him. He was offered the possibility of saving his life by returning to living as a woman. He preferred death.

David Jans, born Martigen Jens in the seventeenth century in the Netherlands, tried to to join the army at sixteen, then went to work making silk thread. He was just one of fifty-four recorded FTMs of the 1600s in the Netherlands; an unknown number more were able to live and die as men without incident.‚Äù",1696333096.0

There are too many historical communities of trans people to sit here and argue this.

Look up the hijra

‚ÄúRoman emperor Elagabalus (d. 222 AD) preferred to be called a lady (rather than a lord) and sought sex reassignment surgery, and in the modern day has been seen as a trans figure. Hijras on the Indian subcontinent and kathoeys in Thailand have formed trans-feminine third gender social and spiritual communities since ancient times, with their presence documented for thousands of years in texts which also mention trans male figures. Today, at least half a million hijras live in India and another half million in Bangladesh, legally recognized as a third gender, and many trans people are accepted in Thailand. In Arabia, khanith today (like earlier mukhannathun) fulfill a third gender role attested since the AD 600s. In Africa, many societies have traditional roles for trans women and trans men, some of which survive in the modern era. In the Americas prior to European colonization, as well as in some contemporary North American Indigenous cultures, there are social and ceremonial roles for third gender people, or those whose gender expression transforms, such as the Navajo n√°dleehi or the Zuni lhamana.‚Äù",1696303358.0

"This is the practical outcome of a hilariously insane asylum policy that allows unlimited number of claims and then releasing people into interior of US while pending hearing. The policy itself and those who advocate for it need to be in an asylum.

You can't have asylum system allowing unlimited number of applications and release into interior pending hearing. There's never going to be enough judges and ICE agents in the world to keep up with the numbers of those who would love to exploit such a silly system. What's going to happen, and has happened, is these people will clog up the system and then released into interior knowing full well that the chance of them actually being deported is small as long as they aren't murderers, rapists, or terrorists, aided no less by fancy termed democrat executive policies like ""prosecutorial discretion"" or ""enforcement priority"", and ""sanctuary cities"". In the meantime they'll be inside US for years along with their kids, and the the public gets guilttripped about deporting them after them having been in US for years. Now all of a sudden the talking point focus turns from ""they need to be released into interior while pending asylum"" to how deporting them would separate families. Give me a break.

Not to mention the cost of deporting someone who is in the interior, which is often brought up in bad faith by those wanting amnesty, yet same people will support this silly policy of releasing hundreds of thousands of people into the interior per year.

They keep coming and claiming asylum because they know there's no limit on how many can be let in, that they can practically be in the US for years, protected from deportation by democrats, and then years later the public will get guilttripped into giving them citizenship. For most of these people, being a few years in the US beats having to spend lifetime in the likes of Guatemala.

What exactly is the scenario that a democrat pictures in his head when a migrant family is released into interior pending hearing? Assuming the migrant is dumb enough to show up for the hearing, that after years of being in the US, the family packs up to go back to Guatemala because he got a letter in the mail saying his asylum is denied, as most of them are? Or would it be that they would stay in the US as long as possible until ICE comes to drag them away, and ICE, being overwhelmed by the numbers and obstructed by democrat policies, probably won't encounter them unless their name pops up in criminal proceeding.

"Let me point out something you may not like, in the low skilled job sector there is significant demand for workers for the first time in decades, no one wants to go work some BS job for $15 an hour, when you can work remotely, and make 70K a year from your own home. Workers finally have begun to stick it to their employers, and demanded work from home, better schedules, and more benefits. 

No one want to work full time in an office again, and employers are taking notice. This has also affected low skill worker positions.

This gap and demand in low skilled workers is going to force employers to start competing again, in order to bring back workers. 

They will have too raise wages, improve working conditions, and offer better benefits for low skilled positions.

However if you surge in a bunch of other low skilled workers who are desperate for income, those jobs will quickly fill up, and employers will no longer have an incentive to raise wages or provide better benefits. Why would they? They have a bunch of people desperately looking for work who will take scraps for wages. 

This is just basic economic theory:

When unemployment is high, benefits, pay, and worker rights are less. When unemployment is low workers have way more leverage, why would I work for you when John down the street is offering me more money? 

Therefore  what should NYC do?

Should you turn them away? No, give them a social security number and send them to work, 2000 people in a city of 7 million is nothing, if this continues however NYC might seriously have a problem.",1665604740.0

Stop spreading lies. The issue has always been about treating people humanely. People equate this with wanting an open border policy. And it's not the same thing.

> The vast majority of these people have no legitimate claim to asylum. Desire for better economic opportunity is not a legitimate asylum claim.

I do not disagree with that. But then you need to come up with a better way to handle asylum cases. Because you can't just make a judgment based on the majority of cases and say none of them are legitimate.

> If they don't support reducing the number of people coming into the country right now, I don't think can be called anything remotely close to common sense. The current numbers do not reflect a viable long-term immigration strategy.

This country has plenty of space for legal immigration. The problem is no one wants to deal with it in a common sense way. Or in some cases you have states that simply don‚Äôt believe in funding for those kinds of services.

The problem in New York is that we have laws that require we provide shelter for the homeless. Obviously there's a cost to this long term and more importantly when there‚Äôs a huge wave a huge cost short term.

Immigrants are generally a positive on our economy. Undocumented workers pay into social security without ever getting access to it. Our birth rates are declining.

"Why you gotta be like that? What kool aid am I drinking? I'm not insulting you so why say that?

No doubt each state has their own individual set of issues they need to deal with. But what does that have to do with New York? The problem here is with Congress that simply refuses to address the issue. It's got nothing to do with anything New York or any other blue states are doing. All Democrats are saying is to treat people humanely. Don't lie to them. Don't separate them from their families.

I don't have concrete solutions here but I imagine if you tried to approach this from the fact that these are largely economic migrants then you can focus on how we can change our laws to make it easier for people to immigrate to this country legally so they aren't all concentrated on the southern border states. When it can take 10 yrs for some to get legal status in the US, that's a problem. No one is going to wait that long.

Even if we didn't want to deal with that particular issue. The easier thing would just be to throw a bunch of money to expand the courts and staff that are required to process these asylum cases with a lofty goal of 1 day reviews. In all honesty we should be applying this across our entire legal system. It often seems like ""speedy trials"" are anything but. Anyways I digress.

And even for the legal pathways it is hard, expensive, confusing, and can change radically depending on executive policy. Trump, for example, threw giant wrenches into it for millions of residents awaiting green cards.

The US has a shortage of high tech workers, too. We make them go through a lottery system -- not merit, skill, finances -- and when they lose the lottery they have to leave, often forever. And even if you do get in the lottery, you might be waiting 15+ years to get a green card.

Maybe you should have listened to the advice I gave in my first comment instead of downvoting it. Lmao. 

Refugees are not competing with you for middle-income jobs or New York real estate. Also, we just had 75k new yorkers drop dead from COVID, which had an inverse correlation to home value. I do not think adding a fraction of NYC's death total back into the population is going to have a very serious impact on home prices in the face of 6% interest rates from the Fed. 

Finally, I agree that human trafficking people to NYC is not an ideal solution to the migrant crisis. It kind of goes without saying, and wasn't really in the scope of the particular discussion you are entering.

If we did not have all these factors to deal with because we are in a recovering economy then yes, the migrants may not have a negative affect. However, my point is this situation is different from what we have previously faced. Also housing doesn‚Äôt mean owning a home, you realize that most NYers do NOT own their homes? That‚Äôs a sure sign that you have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about. Since the people affected are your average NYer, not someone living in Long Island. Most people that live in the city rent their homes, I‚Äôm sure plenty of people own homes. I‚Äôm talking about overall, at this point how can you not see the negative affect this may have? Not just on NYers but the migrants themselves, do you want them sleeping on the floor in the dead of winter? The warmer states is easier to deal with the upcoming weather, but people can freeze to death here. We would be no better than any other state that has them camped outside in bad weather.

BTW, the state of emergency released about a billion dollars of federal funding. I'm not really concerned. The education system, homelessness, mental illness, etc, are all separate issues which the city should address. Obviously, focusing on some migrants is not going to fix the school issue; which, as you pointed out, existed before those migrants got here. So it would be pretty fucking stupid to start expelling migrants as a means to solve that problem. 

Anyway, I think I'm done with this convo. Let me know if you have any questions. If you think that the migrants are causing an economic issue, I have a piece of advice.

All you said you are an expert in this field, great! Please provide current information on how migrates have helped boost an economy after the pandemic and economic hardships in strained systems. Since you are an expert and already stated, there are plenty of resources that state that I would love to read what you already know to be true. 

Going back to address some the point of ‚Äúimagination‚Äù. You realize the city works on a budget, it's not like money comes out of thin air. If this is something that wasn‚Äôt expected or planned we are taking resources already allocated to support something unexpected. It‚Äôs a large surge of people that they already estimated would cost the city a billion dollars. You claim to be so well versed in this issue but only offered a 40 year old study to back your claims. Now you resorted to insults because you have nothing else. You‚Äôre not even considering my points, and I doubt you have any realistic approach to this since you‚Äôre dismissing the fact that the city does don‚Äôt currently have the capacity to deal with this. Migrants needs are shelter, food, health care and often education for their children. Those being bussed are families, the majority are children. My point is all those systems are already strained; you don‚Äôt need economics to know that putting further strain has a negative effect. What part of that is difficult for you to comprehend?  It‚Äôs not an imagination, I linked actual articles to resources that clearly state that. I believe NY is the 2nd city with the most homeless, wouldn‚Äôt migrants add to that? Or are we housing migrants and not people that work here. Since there are plenty of homeless people that work but can‚Äôt afford housing. That‚Äôs just one scenario as to why that will affect NYers in a negative way. You don‚Äôt even have to go far to see that, read the other threads here in NYC about the homeless issue, you will find plenty of users that stated they were homeless for 14 months 5 months or 10 months while working a full time job. 

Migrant workers can help an economy when there is a large demand for low skill jobs in the long run. Yes, I‚Äôm aware of this, but you still have to provide resources to those workers for several months even years. Resources we didn‚Äôt have and had to ask the federal government for help.

"NYC agencies ordered to use their properties, staff for migrant housing and services as city hits crisis point
By Chris Sommerfeldt
New York Daily News

Mayor Adams‚Äô office is ordering all city government agencies to identify properties they own that can be converted into emergency housing for asylum seekers as the local migrant crisis continues to deepen.


Camille Varlack, Adams‚Äô chief of staff, issued the directive in a Sunday letter to all agency heads. The letter, which was obtained by the Daily News, also asks all agency brass to check if they have any employees who‚Äôd be willing to help staff new migrant housing facilities.


‚ÄúWith more asylum seekers arriving daily, this influx has pushed our shelter system to a breaking point and we need to create emergency temporary sites,‚Äù Varlack wrote.


Sites that could be retrofitted into migrant housing must be at least 10,000 square feet, have running water and feature ‚Äúopen layout spaces‚Äù where rows of bunk beds can be set up, according to Varlack‚Äôs missive. Sites should have ‚Äúno known health hazards,‚Äù she added.


Varlack asked agency leaders to submit a list of sites that could potentially be repurposed as housing by 5 p.m. Tuesday.


In addition to identifying properties, Varlack urged agency officials to check in with their workers about taking on 12-hour shifts at migrant housing facilities.


‚ÄúDepending on the staff‚Äôs experience, assignments can include site managers, or deputy managers,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúIn addition, staff can volunteer in other roles such as general support, security, cleaning and other human service-related responsibilities.‚Äù


It‚Äôs a plus if workers can speak Spanish, and Varlack said they will be eligible for ‚Äúovertime/flex-time‚Äù pay.


The unusual orders from Varlack come on the heels of the administration opening an emergency migrant housing site at the NYPD‚Äôs old Police Academy building in Manhattan ‚Äî where children were admitted over the weekend in a potential violation of local shelter rules, as first reported by the Daily News.


There are currently more than 37,500 migrants living in city shelters, hotels and other sites, costing the city millions of dollars per day, according to Adams‚Äô office. Most of the migrants are fleeing violence and poverty in their Latin American home countries and ended up in New York after crossing into the U.S. from Mexico in hopes of securing asylum.


Adams spokesman Fabien Levy indicated the administration‚Äôs search for more spaces to house migrants is in part motivated by this week‚Äôs expiration of Title 42, a Trump-era policy that has prevented many asylum seekers from entering the U.S.


‚ÄúThis weekend alone, we received hundreds of asylum seekers every day, and with Title 42 set to be lifted this week, we expect more to arrive in our city daily,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are considering a multitude of options, but, as we‚Äôve been saying for a year, we desperately need federal and state support to manage this crisis.‚Äù",1683634540.0

"I am a liberal. NYC needs to share this burden with all 50 states. They raided the public hospital funds to pay for the migrants.  They announced they are closing the libraries in the weekends too in order to come up with the funds.  They are discussing sanitation too. Homeowners got their properties reassessed last year. NYC decided my house, which needs a new roof, bathroom, and kitchen was somehow worth 200K more. It‚Äôs not but pretty sure the big hike in property taxes is to help make the predicted 4.5B budget shortfall.  Between our federal, state, and resident income taxes (yes you pay a tax to live in the city) we are the highest taxed population in the country and you can‚Äôt even use the library on the weekend. Taking money out of the public hospital budget doesn‚Äôt hurt me but it does hurt minority and undocumented communities that rely on them.

Now they are talking about setting up a tent city in Central Park, Orchard Beach and Citifield. You do know Orchard Beach mostly serves a minority community in the Bronx 

NYC has done its part.  We are permanently housing, in the most expensive city in the country, around 60,000 migrants who have stayed far longer than the average 4 month stay. It doesn‚Äôt look like most will be moving out soon.  The average room in a homeless shelter runs about 4300K a month not including the food, medical etc. 

It‚Äôs time to share the financial burden in cheaper locals. Let NYC process and decompress it‚Äôs overwhelmed homeless system before more are bussed in.  That‚Äôs all we are saying here.  My father-in-law was stateless and a refugee, my husband an immigrant. ‚Ä¶ so we are very sympathetic to those trying to come here but it‚Äôs a big country and more than a couple of cities should shoulder the burden.

In my experience, it also varies by your address how much information you're automatically given to enable you to vote. Right now I get flyers in the mail that are super clear saying the voting dates, where I need to go, my district number etc. I never got anything like that at my old address in another county/district I lived at for several years. In fact the only things I did get at my old address were I think scam forms trying to confuse people. I had a mess in the pandemic getting the mail in ballot because I had somehow gotten my ballot mistakenly switched to a military one that I couldn't use when I responded to a notice that said it was from the city asking me to confirm that I needed a mail-in.

I keep on top of politics a little but someone who doesn't has a terrible chance of being aware of the dates, process, and candidates. And I don't accept that said people would 'make a bad voter'.

And... we're not at all talking about Adams raising the department and personnel budgets by around 15% or more due to raises agreed to (including retroactive payments) by Mayor Adams in the last two years. 

The police budget right now is WAY higher than what it was when de Blasio left office in January 2022. That ""budget"" goes into a black hole of I-don't-know-what, because NYPD does not break down their spending in any public reports. It's hard to know what is getting adjusted up or down, it's hard to know what is being increased or decreased. It's absolutely possible that we're spending a lot more and there are fewer personnel on patrols. 

I think, if you can find a specific service or patrol that NYPD provides where there is public information about cutbacks, we could talk about that.

"My response to the video:

1. I agree, immigrants dont commit crimes on a particularly large scale. However, there are two things worth noting with this fact. 

a) Crime by US citizens is (unfortunately) inflated by a single demographic, people not pertaining this demographic commit crimes at a lower rate than immigrants.

b) The US Mexico border does have a huge concentration of human and drug trafficking and murder by cartels. 

2. So she said that immigrants go for jobs such as construction, gardening and child care because they're low pay and non-unionized. That's my point, immigrants going for those jobs makes it impossible for US born workers to negotiate for higher pay and unionization in those sectors BECAUSE there's a giant pool of labor that is willing to replace them for lower pay.

3. I never claimed any problems with integration / assimilation. My parents are (legal) immigrants from Colombia. US culture is unique in that it isn't fixed, it's ever changing. 

  
You didn't disprove anything I was positing. The only point she touched on which I brought up was #2.",1727285709.0

"So here's the joke: The FEDERAL government (Repubs AND Dems) has consistently SLASHED the goddamned budget for immigration courts and has NO plan or funds for federal migrant housing centers while they wait,  which is currently at a 2 million case backlog.

So, the solution is actually simplistically bureaucratic and financial: Require asylum seekers to apply for asylum IMMEDIATELY  and not within a year as is now the case,  fund a massive expansion of immigration courts to deal with the backlog and future cases in a speedy manner, change the policy to require ALL cases be adjudicated within 6 months, and require SPEEDY deportation if cases are lost, and finally, DO NOT grant work permits UNTIL a person is formally granted asylum, which should ideally be within six months if the applicant proves the credible threat requirement.

Asylum is NOT about ""WORK,"" and how rich or poor one is is irrelevant to applying for asylum because of a credible fear from political actors in ones home country, so if migrants are so concerned about receiving ""work permits,"" it kind of reveals  their true motivations! Shouldn't they be just grateful that they are ""safe"" in the first place?

All of these changes would be CHEAPER than how much is currently being wasted on this chaos, AND future migrants would be deterred for coming for economic reasons without legitimate fear-based claims, and the private sector/nonprofits wouldn't be motivated by their own selfish greed to perpetuate economic migration.

Homeless hotels are/were usually budget hotels in the outer boroughs or lower Manhattan; not luxury hotels like The Watson.

Shelter over-crowding has been a persistent issue for years to the point where homeless people prefer sleeping on the street vs risking their safety at a shelter, but the city has never established large-scale, climate-controlled pop-up shelters that provided people with hot meals 3x a day.

You could increase the amount of federal immigration judges tenfold and it would still not be enough to process the amount of asylum claims that are pending.

There is a resource issue of course, but it is an issue largely caused by the fact that the US allows people into the country to claim asylum if they pass a ""credible fear"" assessment, which is significantly lower and more vague than the criteria to actually qualify for asylum.

Are you talking housing or shelters?

If you mean the former, given the general NIMBY warfare in this city with housing, it would be a total shitshow if migrants with dubious legal status were prioritized for housing.

If you mean the latter, there is never going to be enough shelters to accommodate literally thousands of homeless people coming here every week.

Even if TX stopped bussing migrants here, they send less than 1,000 every month going by their own numbers, which comes out to 250 less migrants a week on average.

Still wholly unsustainable.

Children who are US citizens can receive welfare benefits for them, just like any other family. Because they are minors, the benefits are administered by the parents.

SNAP will only pay out benefits for 1 person (the citizen child), while still counting the illegal immigrant parents' income when determining family income/size. SNAP does NOT pay out ""entirely family benefits"" just because one dependent is a citizen. 

For example, if a minor has a job, the money they earn is ""their"" money. Whether they are a 17 year old cashier at Burger King or a child actor like Macaulay Culkin, we don't say ""the parents of the child received money."" We say the child earned the money. 

It happens to be that because they're a minor, the parents can exercise significant control over their child's money. Are there parents that abuse this control? Yeah, sure, but it's still not accurate to say ""it's the parents' money/benefits.""

Local leaders are currently struggling to house more than 57,000 asylum seekers in the city's care ‚Äî with more arriving each week.

In midtown Manhattan, asylum seekers are sleeping on the sidewalks outside the Roosevelt Hotel.

In an interview with ""CBS Mornings,"" Adams said the urgency of providing support is a ""national issue"" that needs immediate action as the city grapples financial demands putting pressure on essential municipal services. Adams said the city is on pace to spend billions in migrant care this fiscal year.

The federal government's inaction isn't due to DHS being upset over sanctuary policies, especially since it does not contradict current DHS policy where being illegally in the country is not grounds for removal.

Secondly, asylum seekers wouldn't be subject to removal unless they remain after their claim is denied or they arrive and never apply for asylum within the 1 yr window.

The problem is that border *towns* shouldnt have to deal with this. The *federal government* should.

The result is that those border towns get overrun with untracked, unverified, and unidentified migrants who are constantly trying to avoid detection. 

Both new york and texas, in two very distinct ways with two opposite policies, end up having migrants in the places they shouldn't be: in residential areas in towns and cities. 

Of course, Texas refuses federal money on immigration. Because they know if they took their money, they would also have to obey their rules.

Many of the migrants we're getting now are from Venezuela due to their dire economy after the U.S. and Europe put some pretty hefty sanctions on their anti-Democratic government that is literally and ally of Cuba. . .  Similarly, once Castro took over in Cuba and established an anti-Democratic government, the U.S. imposed sanctions, nearly crippling their economy and sending waves of Cuban migrants to U.S. shores.

>helping the people also helped in our fights against the Soviet Union and communism.

Citation needed.  Castro famously emptied his prisons of violent criminals and gave them a choice to get on a boat to America or get shot.

If this happened today, this sub would be apoplectic about it.  But here you are pretending it was helpful.

>There were also limits to the number of people that came in. 

Nope.  Before 1995 ALL Cubans that came were given legal status just by showing up.  There was literally no limit.  After 1995 the U.S. move to a [Wet Foot - Dry Foot Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_feet,_dry_feet_policy) where again, there was no limit to the number of Cubans admitted *as long as they made it to U.S. land.*  If they were intercepted in the water, they could be sent to a third country or back to Cuba.

>Also, making it easier is what leads to wage stagnation.

There is no agreement on this amongst economists.  In fact, even some economists that believe that large scale immigration has an effect on wages will admit the effect is likely small and outweighed by the benefits to the economy.

Are you saying that Cuba wasn't sending its best? They were ALL *violent* criminals? Oh, wait, from your article:

>Back in 1980, it seemed to be a humanitarian and patriotic gesture to accept provisionally, without papers or visas, all those fleeing from the port of Mariel. More than 125,000 came. Most were true refugees, many had families here, and the great majority has settled into American communities without mishap. But the Cuban dictator played a cruel joke. He opened his jails and mental hospitals and put their inmates on the boats too.

Ah, so we had hundreds of thousands coming in and THEN Castro did that. And they all were not violent criminals.

>According to Republicans, there is no need to have a minimum wage at all. So color me shocked that you're trying to make a conservative argument by bringing up the minimum wage. 

I'm not a conservative, so why wouldn't I be for the raising of minimum wage? My point is that the idea of doing so is undermined by a constant flow of people that will work for less. The argument against minimum wage is that removing it would cause pure competition forcing employers to have to raise it. My only argument against this lies in the fact that with a constant flow of people that will drive down the minimum, so it won't work. Whether we have a minimum wage or we don't the influx of undocumented workers will keep wages depressed.

[deleted],1691702516.0
"They're not coming here and claiming asylum at the border. They're crossing illegally at non-border-entry-points, and claiming asylum only once they are caught in order to delay the deportation process.

So to clarify they: **avoid proper entry points** > **cross illegally** > **get caught** > THEN claim asylum. If they could have gotten in without getting caught, they would not claim asylum. 

This is why in sanctuary cities, the cities won't cooperate with ICE. They can go there without claiming asylum and as long as they don't bump into the feds directly, hang around indefinitely. 

Also, if they don't qualify for asylum, they're just abusing a system and making the process for those that do qualify. Just look at the numbers in NYC. [We only have around 57K asylum seekers, while 100K came in since last spring.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/nyc-struggling-demand-supporting-asylum-seekers-mayor-adams/story?id=102100195#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20mayor's%20office,have%20arrived%20since%20last%20spring.) Thing is, those 57K aren't all from that 100K because we had asylum seekers before that. 

But let's assume that it is. That means that we're dealing with twice as many people because of the illegal border crossing. And of that 57K, probably around 60%-70% will be denied asylum, based on recent denial rates. 

So the whole city's system is jammed up, AND the asylum court/process is dealing with more than double the number of people that it really should. We would have been better served, and would need less money, to knoy process 20-30K asylums.",1691726837.0

They still crossed illegally, and if they don't qualify for asylum, they get deported. They get a temporary legal status as ""asylum seeker"" but if status isn't granted, they revert back to their previous status and are sent back.

So people that do not qualify for asylum are using asylum status as a stay against deportation, delaying the inevitable while slowing up the system for those that do qualify and increasing the cost to tax payers.

Actually, I should expand on that. They weren't planning to go through the process because they weren't expecting to get caught.

Because the programs are now in place to do so. IN the past, there was no social support services of this level, no free hotel stays, 3 meals a day, and healthcare.

You can not survive anywhere in this country without money, not unless, of course, the government pays for your food and housing.

I was just discussing with a friend from Mexico for some perspective, he said the average wage is $120-150 USD per week for skilled labor, construction, etc in Mexico. That is the minimum DAILY wage I see here in NYC for skilled labor. Close to $200 a day is more accurate. IF the working age male migrants needed to, they would disperse across the region and be able to find work. But at this point, nobody needs to, because the city is footing the bill. Why would I work when I can have my needs met for free? ""Let me see what I can squeeze out of these dumb Americans before I have to find a job to support myself""

">You mean over the years since Biden took over, right?

Ha no. The asylum backlog has been building for decades. It increased substantially during the Trump administration.

>Just want to make that clear. Record high asylum seekers under the Biden admin. Agreed?

Record number of asylum seekers *processed*. These include people who arrived years ago but haven't yet been processed. 

>https://oversight.house.gov/release/grothman-biden-open-border-policies-led-to-historic-encounters-of-unaccompanied-alien-children/

We don't have an open border. Biden continued Trump's border policy (title 42) until just a few months ago. Since changing the policy, border crossings have been falling. 

>This admin is a disaster. You are refusing to see what Biden has done. 

This admin has been one of the most effective in getting bipartisan legislation passed, from the infrastructure bill to the CHIPS act.

>I‚Äôm all for helping people, but do it the proper way. Apply and wait like everyone else. You‚Äôre ok with people coming through the souther border and just claiming asylum? That‚Äôs insane. 

Asylum seekers, by definition, cannot wait. They are in imminent danger. If they make a false asylum claim, they will be deported.

The President is required to process asylum seekers by law. The last time Congress passed immigration reform was in the 80s under Reagan and they strengthened protections for asylum seekers and refugees.

>The southern border has obviously been an issue. But you seriously can‚Äôt admit that Biden made it 10x worse? 

Again, Biden just continued Trump's title 42 border policy. Ever since that changed, the border situation has gotten better.",1691076265.0

Republicans love to hate illegal immigrants to your face, but if anything their donors are the ones who abuse illegal immigrants for cheap labor the most, and so all immigration policies are based on the idea that we need the cheap labor, but fuck anyone providing that and fuck giving them a path to citizenship. Red states rely on illegal immigrants for cheap, grueling labor that gets around labor laws (I‚Äôm sure California does too, but let‚Äôs be real.)

Source1: https://www.texastribune.org/2016/12/14/lawmakers-go-easy-employers-undocumented-workers/

Downvoting doesn't make sourced information untrue, folks. We have a problem where businesses exploit labor and yet republicans REEE like children over illegal immigrants when their donors are the ones actively exploiting the problem and making it worse. Specifically as it pertains to STATE legislatures and the need for grueling, awful physical labor in picking fruits and veggies that you and I buy at the grocery store.

Republicans in state legislatures *will not* address the businesses in southern farming states that depend on these sources of undocumented labor.

"I have kind of the opposite interpretation, this is very cheap compared to hotels (which is what I would expect, given that the setup sounds very bare-bones, like cots in a big room in a basement). However, since churches are non-profits and tax exempt, I don‚Äôt understand why it costs so much to house migrants there. Based on the article, the $85 a night doesn‚Äôt include other services like laundry or security‚Äîwhich, when added, bump the price up to $125/migrant/night. It‚Äôs not like there is an opportunity cost for the churches, as there is for hotels. Ostensibly, the migrants also can‚Äôt just hang out in the church all day if they wish, like a hotel room‚Äîthis is just to house them at night.

">what is Abbott exaggerating at the border

Assume no one is in good faith so here it is.

He literally brought the national guard on a mission to do fuck all with no authority and had people sit around with poor supplies until natural guardsman lost their jobs and killed themselves. They couldn't do anything other than sit in waiting and had zero arrest or enforcement power.

https://www.texastribune.org/2022/10/04/texas-national-guard-suicide-operation-lone-star/

Defunded tons of other part of the Texas budget for political stunts at the border qity questionable returns past culture war points with people for a presidential campaign when no one will ever let Abbott win a presidential primary.

https://www.texastribune.org/2022/04/29/greg-abbott-texas-border-mission-funding/

Did a random change in border policy checkpoints, confiscated zero drugs or illicit substances, caused tons of food and disruption at an essential border checkpoint, all at the height of supply chain and food inflation issues. Tons of food expired worthless. Colossal waste of money, zero results, not even even MAGA diehard performance lovers, forced Mexico to invest heavily in a new Arizona border checkpoint, potentially losing tons of business for Texan shipping lane businesses.

The history of the black church helping to make low income neighborhoods in NYC safer is pretty well documented, and if churches were compensated for their help in that (I am 99% sure they weren't) then I would say that's a social investment well spent.

For instance, I am dubious about your claim that religious organizations have a set aside sum of 300 million dollars, considering according to the DOJ:

>The Federal government does not set aside a separate funding stream specifically for faith-based groups. Rather, they are eligible to apply for government grants on an equal footing with other similar non-governmental organizations.

I know they don't pay taxes, most non-profits have a different tax structure than your average for profit corporation and I think that's a good thing.

> So a charity that caters to say, Moslems or Orthodox Jews who have unique dietary and cultural restrictions should be served by government workers who may be insensitive?


Any charity that caters to one religion should not be funded by the government.  And the government should be equally as sensitive to the dietary requirements of ALL people (whether it be kosher, halal, vegan, gluten-free, etc)


> So government should have to pay to acquire the infrastructure (cooling and senior centers, meals on wheels trucks etc.) and have to hire all the (unionized) people needed to run them?


Emphatically YES!  Why are they giving religious organizations money to acquire and build out the infrastructure rather than owning it and doing it themselves?  (The fact that you put ""unionized"" in parenthesis makes me think that you believe that churches can do it cheaper, so they should.  But I think that a fair wage and employee representation are incredibly important, so if it costs more for union employees than church volunteers, I still support that 100%.  Because screwing over one employee so that you can be charitable to a stranger doesn't sound like the correct solution here.)


>Should we pull all currency (""In God We Trust"")? Amend the Declaration of Independence (""We hold these Truths self evident...endowed by the Creator"")? What about military graveyards (somehow I doubt that you've visited any) with their crosses?


Also an overwhelming YES!!! ""In God We Trust"" was not added to our currency until the 1950's -- and it NEVER should have happened!  Declaration of Independence doesn't mention God, but yes it should not reference one. And as for military graveyards, you are correct that I have not visited any.  I think that anyone should be able to put whatever they want on their grave (or their home or their body or their property) but if the government puts crosses on all of them automatically then yes that practice should be stopped.


Religion has no place in government.  And saying that ""well as long as the government doesn't pick just one religion and stays neutral that's good enough"" is dangerous.

Why **can't** a government be agnostic?  What exactly is the problem you have with that?  


If history has taught us anything, it's that the majority of evil in this world has been carried out in the name of religion or God(s).  So why should the government support religious groups in order to be charitable, rather than just doing it themselves?

Your quote defining whataboutism here:

Also supports my conclusion. Your quote here does not talk about how you felt when you were typing the original response out. You responded to *my criticism* by diverting attention to *a different issue*. To spell it out for you, functionally, democrat and republican non-action on this would be separate issues.

For the trillionth time, **in your own words**:

You start your sentence with the italicized. These words are aimed not at continuing conversing the topic, this was a condescending beginning to a shift in topic.

The bold part emphasizes that in fact, you do not wish to converse, at all, about what I brought up, but rather *another* topic. In this case, Democrats.

Second italicized part asserts that they had a chance to do something and we should discuss that. Discussing that doesn't add anything of value to bringing attention to Republican willfull maliciousness and cruelty. It takes us down another rabbit hole where you want to excuse republicans failure to act on immigration and their cruelty to say democrats are the same and/or worse.

">	New York City‚Äôs migrant crisis ‚Äúcould go on for years‚Äù if the Biden administration doesn‚Äôt fork over more federal aid, Mayor Eric Adams‚Äô top budget official declared Tuesday, slamming the already allocated $38.5 million as so puny it doesn‚Äôt even cover a full week of migrant-related expenses. 

>‚ÄúThe reality is this is a fiscal emergency,‚Äù warned Jacques Jiha, the city‚Äôs Office of Budget and Management Director, before a City Council hearing on the executive budget due June 30. 

>He said Gotham is currently receiving a daily average of 602 new migrant arrivals ‚Äì an eye-popping increase compared to the 217 average daily arrivals just over two months ago, in early March.

>‚ÄúIf this trajectory continues, asylum seeker costs will grow dramatically above the $4.3 billion forecast,‚Äù said Jiha.  

>‚ÄúWe have been awarded thus far only $38.5 million by the federal government. Let me put that in perspective: at our current daily spending rate, that $38.5 million barely covers five days of asylum seeker costs.‚Äù",1684869951.0
"I'll give ya'll the facts:

1. Border apprehensions and surges skyrocketed under Biden's presidency. Look at how once Biden took over, the amount of apprehensions increased. When interviewed, migrants specifically stated that they believed Biden would let them inbecause well, who runs the Democratic party? Progressives. And Biden needs them to win elections.  
   
[https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters?language\_content\_entity=en](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters?language_content_entity=en)  

2. According to estimates, it will cost around $4-5 billion per year to house the migrants. This is just to pay for housing. These migrants are entitled to education, healthcare, and other public services. NYC currently spends $37k per student from K-12 on education per year. Since many of these migrant children likely won't speak English, they will require ESL classes - further increasing the cost of education and taking up more resources (schools, classroom capacity, etc.,).   

3. Many of these asylum-seekers are not eligible for asylum but because they can claim asylum, they are entitled to stay in the country. They know that their court cases won't be available for maybe even years so they can continue receiving benefits, housing, and other services until then. If they receive an order of deportation, they're going to disappear into the country never to be found again. They aren't eligible because seeking asylum for economic opportunity is not a legitimate case.   

4. If the amount of asylum-seekers is 'too high' for you, think about all the illegal immigrants who are coming into this country. It's hundreds of thousands per year at conservative estimates. That means you have hundreds of thousands of people who you have no info about, could be sexual offenders, could be violent criminals, could be drug cartel members, could be gang members, etc., If your family becomes a victim to one of these criminals, guess what? The government failed you. And don't forget, there is a large prison population (both federal/state) housing a large % of illegal immigrants who were arrested but can't be deported because they have no idea who and where they are coming from. That's tax dollars going to a prison system to house people who aren't even supposed to be in this country.  

5. Your taxes are going up. Let's not kid ourselves.   

6. Biden's administration is not serious about solving immigration because again, this is a political issue that would cause him votes. Democrats know this. If illegal immigrants kids born in America voted for Republicans, I guarantee you Democrats would be in Congress voting for every policy to prevent the flow of illegal immigrants. Biden hasn't visited the border once since becoming president. That's 30 months. Yet, when you ask Americans, the border is one of the biggest issues. He sent Kamala Harris there and I'm sure you are all very aware by now that Kamala Harris avoided the areas that were hit the hardest and didn't even speak to CBP personnel on what the issues are. Instead, she went to the facilities that were cleaned up so she can make a media appearance.  


Let's be honest here: We are not the United Countries of Humans. We are the United States of America. The limited amount of taxpayers (50% of Americans do not pay a single penny of federal income taxes) cannot support more individuals who will not contribute to the economy. I don't blame these individuals for coming into America and taking advantage of what America has to offer. I'd do the same. I blame politicians and the government for not fixing this issue because there is either money involved or political consequences that are unfavorable to them. This isn't about sympathy. The reality is, every country has the soverign right to defend their borders and right now, it's a travesty America isn't defending their own.",1684945805.0

When were the borders closed?,1684888967.0
"No. This is all about Gov. Abbott of Texas being a major league asshole driven to crash cities that he obviously views as ideological enemies. And the federal government's puzzling lack of response to this extraordinary chain of events. 

1. Gov. Abbott's argument is that he's doing this to spare the border towns and cities from being further overwhelmed. True, the border towns and cities don't have the resources to care for all the migrants. But just because Abbott is busing them out doesn't mean that they're not being overwhelmed even now. And he's STILL not doing a damn thing to give them extra funding or personnel. 

2. The only thing he's doing is sending state troopers to do federal duties of border patrol. With the express purpose of embarrassing the feds by making it look like they're Keystone Kops. 

3. His administration had a $23 billion surplus just now. 23 FUCKING BILLION DOLLARS. And that's on top of federal funding to carry out their duties as a border state. Don't tell me that he couldn't use just a fraction of the surplus to better fund the border cities and towns, along with the state's trainwreck of an education system. And if Abbott won't use the federal funding for its intended purpose, he should surrender it so New York can use it. He can't have his cake and eat it too.

4. There's no excuse for Abbott not to coordinate with the governments of New York City and New York State about this. It's his responsibility as a fellow state official to do so. The fact that he won't do it shows that he knows full well what he's doing. In other words, overwhelming NYC's resources and bringing its social services to near-collapse is the whole point. 

4. FWIW, Abbott is deeply disliked by Texas' cities, large towns and border cities. They oppose this bussing just as much as we do in New York. They feel that it's a waste of valuable resources that could be used elsewhere. 

5. Let's be honest - this migrant crisis has nothing to do with the migrants. For one thing, it has everything to do with state demographics. Abbott and Texas Republicans know their stranglehold on state gov't hangs by a thread. They're in office because gerrymandering gives Texas' suburban, exurban and rural counties more power than the towns and cities where 90% of its population actually lives. The suburban, exurban and rural counties are overwhelmingly Anglo and lean Republican. The towns and cities have large minority populations and overwhelmingly lean Democratic. Most of its population growth is happening in its cities. In the face of that, gerrymandering can only do so much. By bussing out the mainly Latino migrants, it helps maintain the status quo that keeps Texas Republicans in power. 

6. It also has to do with national politics. Conservatives lean farther to the right these days, and are adapting a much more antagonistic stance towards those they consider ideological enemies. They are done with giving lip service to tolerance of other points of view (e.g. the bad faith argument of ""states' rights""). Right now, their goal is to dominate and crush the opposition. As such, New York City represents a vision of America that they find intimidating and unacceptable. The far right wishes to destroy what it cannot control. In New York City's case, one of the best ways to do so is rendering its sophisticated public apparatus nonfunctional. This along with anti-sex, anti-abortion, and anti-education measures are part of a larger cold civil war in progress against Democratic-controlled areas. (Attention to New York City residents - You don't need to wait anymore for civil war. IMHO, the second civil war has already begun. It just isn't a hot one - yet.)

7. The federal government's lack of response is truly puzzling. On one hand, Biden could forcefully tell Abbott and Texas Republicans to behave themselves, since they're meddling in federal affairs. On the other hand, Biden could give more federal funding to New York City, including taking away Texas' apportionment of border-related funding. He's not doing either one, and it's mysterious why he won't. If Biden is afraid of Republican blowback, he might as well give up trying to get them on his side. The Republicans are amply demonstrating that they won't accept anyone who doesn't march in lockstep with ideology. He can't put one of the largest donor states in peril so he can pursue Republican votes in vain.",1684882431.0

We don't have a problem with the migrants coming. It's how they being sent that's the issue.

New York is a border state too. But by virtue of our geographic location, our flows are different in nature from those of Texas. Abbott is imposing on New York's resources without giving the gov't a chance to expand capacity - which is the whole point. 

Texas' border cities and towns indeed need help. But despite all his bitching and moaning, Abbott isn't doing a thing for them. What's your answer to that?

All we ask is - 

* that Abbott coordinate with the gov'ts of New York City and New York State on this. That way, the region can expand its capacity to accept them. A huge part of the problem is that the city has been left on the backfoot.
* that the feds allow the migrants to legally work. We need the workers and they want to work. No brainer here.

Wow, you really want me to embarrass you on this forum, don't you? Okay my friend, wish granted.

First of all, I don't know where you got the 5.3 million number from. I can't see that in the article so there's that. 

But consider the following points:

* By and large, expenses in Texas are much lower than anything you'll find in the five boroughs of New York City. Even the poorest borough (the Bronx) has higher expenses than most of Texas
* A lot of expense comes from NYC paying hotels to house the migrants. This is an expense that probably wouldn't be necessary or possible in Texas. The number of hotel rooms in NYC likely dwarfs the number in ~~all of Texas~~ any city in Texas. In all likelihood, temporary shelters would be set up in Texas, which would be cheaper by its nature.
* $38.5 million is 0.167% of $23 billion. Again, it's a drop in the bucket. Just 10% to 20% of that $23 billion could do wonders. 

So since you got your ass handed to you for your shitty math skills, you now resort to blatantly xenophobic union arguments. 

> We union workers all work together, people from all backgrounds but the non-union companies only hire undocumented because they work without bennies and they work for 1/3 of what we fought so hard to get.

Okay...so why doesn't your union bring in those undocumented workers? Why isn't your union actively working to make them union members? Since you and your fellow union members care so much about this, why don't you lobby your union to do it?

I'm sure that those migrant workers would love to get the higher pay and job protection that union jobs offer. And you don't need to be a citizen (or even documented) to join a union. And if being documented is so important, certainly your union can lobby to give the migrants temporary work authorization.

"No, I don't see how that's true.

First of all, when Biden came in, Trump's Title 42 was still in effect. And despite efforts to end it, enforcement only ended a few weeks ago. Right now, Title 8 is in effect, which is arguably even stricter than Title 42. Which is why, prior to expectations, there's been no surge at the border.

Really, the only thing that's changed is that Biden is taking a less hostile stance towards the Latino migrants. 

And tbh, the current crisis has little to do with Biden. It has to do with bipartisan incompetence in reforming our immigration policy into something that works. It's BECAUSE our current system is so dysfunctional that undocumented immigration is so huge. When it's so hard to do it legally (and I have a cousin in Latin America who's tried to do so), what else do you expect people to do?

Plus, let's call a spade a spade. When Texas Republicans complain about ""inaction at the border"", they really want the southern border completely closed, particularly to Latino immigrants. *That is unrealistic, unreasonable and unworkable.* They also have no right to make that call, or have any right to enforce it, as Abbott is trying to do with his forces. 

And Abbott in particular has no right to demand that. He's bitching all over the place about how the border cities are suffering.

"Wait what? The way that you define different levels of elections is very confusing.

National elections involve positions at the federal level, like U.S. President and Congressional seats.

Statewide elections involve positions at the state level, like governor, state senate, state assembly, attorney general and other state offices. 

Local, county or municipal elections involve positions within the county or city government. This includes mayor, county executive, local council members, and other local offices. 

State legislature elections are statewide AND legislative elections, and by your own admission, are affected by gerrymandering. By definition, presidential elections are NOT statewide elections. The distinction you draw between legislative and statewide elections, and the way you define statewide elections, makes no sense at all.

And this semantic argument brings us away from my main point - gerrymandering DOES affect statewide and federal elections SIGNIFICANTLY. And while elections for president, governor and senator aren't directly affected by gerrymandering, they are definitely impacted indirectly. By influencing legislative districts, gerrymandering affects how much power those officials will have in office.

>BROOKLYN, N.Y.‚ÄîThe migrant crisis in New York City is pushing some Asian-Americans, part of a growing voting bloc, to reconsider their political allegiances.  
Asian-Americans in New York City have traditionally favored Democrats, but in recent years have shifted toward more Republicans in local races, largely out of frustration with Democrats on issues such as education reform and curbing anti-Asian violence.   
More recently, immigration has proven to be another issue over which Asian-Americans are diverging from Democrats as migrants from Central America, South America and elsewhere continue to arrive in New York. More than 100,000 migrants have come to New York City since the spring of 2022, and the city has worked to find shelter for many of them.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the No. 1 thing that is front and center for voters as we‚Äôre heading to poll sites,‚Äù said Yiatin Chu, president of the Asian Wave Alliance, a nonpartisan political club in the city.  
Frustrations over the migrant issue were recently on display in Brooklyn‚Äôs Sunset Park, a longtime gathering spot for neighborhood residents, many of whom are of Chinese origin. Some say the city‚Äôs placement of an emergency shelter for migrants here early last month has changed the nature of the park.   
The shelter is one of the city‚Äôs more than 200 emergency shelters for migrants. Half of a recreation center there, which used to be a gym and community space, housed about 100 single men from South America, Africa and China, according to migrants.   
On a recent day, police patrolled the nearly 25-acre park, as buses of migrants from the southern border arrived at the recreational center. Nonprofit organizations set up tents and tables to help with food and necessities.   
At the entrance to the recreation center, groups of migrants were playing chess or picking up donations. Some said they had started their asylum-seeking paperwork. Most of the migrants were from Latin America and Africa, though a handful were from China. Those interviewed said they were eager to work.  
Nearby, hundreds rallied against the decision to place a shelter at the center.  
Fanny Chen, who moved to Brooklyn from China more than 10 years ago, said that, for many locals, the recreation center was the only place where they socialized with others. Her dance group was able to use the gym. Chen, 45, said previously she wasn‚Äôt registered to vote because issues such as education reform didn‚Äôt affect her‚Äîbut she was considering voting Republican this fall, when a competitive City Council race is on the ballot.  
The November results in this south Brooklyn Asian-majority council district‚Äîcreated following the 2020 census‚Äîcould offer clues about Asian-American voting preferences in 2024. A recent Siena College poll of registered New York voters showed frustration across the state about how Democrats are handling the migrant crisis, from the Biden administration to Gov. Kathy Hochul to Mayor Eric Adams.   
‚ÄúIt appears that the overwhelming majority of New Yorkers of every stripe think that the recent influx is a serious problem that the state needs to address,‚Äù Siena poll spokesman Steve Greenberg said, describing recent poll results of registered voters in New York.  
Both candidates for City Council of the new district showed up at Sunset Park rallies. Ying Tan, the Republican candidate, said as a first-generation immigrant herself, she‚Äôs not against immigration per se, but that the border needs to be closed; resources are already strained to accommodate migrants who are here.  
Susan Zhuang, the Democratic candidate, also opposed using neighborhood spaces to ‚Äúmake up for federal failures,‚Äù according to her tweet. Nearly 500 people signed a petition for Adams started by Zhuang to move the shelter out of the park.   
Amid bipartisan criticism, the Biden administration has introduced new policies this year that stiffen consequences for illegal border crossers while also offering more legal pathways for migrants.   
Asian-American voters remain a stable part of the Democratic coalition nationally, some analysts have found. But Republicans have made gains recently in some places where Asian-American voters are concentrated enough to have a meaningful impact on elections.   
For example, Wall Street Journal analysis finds that in California, former President Donald Trump in 2020 topped 30% support in some census tracts in San Jose and nearby Milpitas, a gain of about 10 percentage points over his 2016 showing in those areas. In those census tracts, Asian voters make up 70% or more of the population, census data show. The Journal analysis found a similar trend in some parts of New York City where Asian-American residents are heavily concentrated.  
Yong Chen, who moved to Brooklyn from China more than 30 years ago, was one of the protesters at the recreation center recently. Until recently, Chen, 64, said his daily routine had been to play ping pong at the center after breakfast.  
‚ÄúLook at us now. Where are we supposed to go?‚Äù Chen said in Mandarin Chinese, pointing to a dozen men around him, his longtime ping-pong pals who were watching children play on the slides. He blamed the crisis on the Biden administration‚Äôs policy to leave the border open. Chen used to vote for Democrats and has decided to vote for Tan in November‚Äôs City Council elections‚Äîand for other Republicans going forward.  
The portion of registered voters in the city who identify as Asian-Americans rose to 11% in 2023 from 3% in 2003, according to data provided by Asian Pacific Americans Voting and Organizing to Increase Civic Engagement, a nonpartisan coalition of community organizations.  
In the 2021 mayoral election, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa won the new Asian-American majority district in south Brooklyn, gaining 60% of votes, compared with 35% for Adams, the CUNY data showed.  
At the park, some longtime residents have welcomed the migrant arrivals. ‚ÄúNo one should tell you otherwise that this place is not ready and happy to welcome immigrants,‚Äù said Alexander Rapaport, director of Masbia, a nonprofit organization that set up soup kitchens outside shelters in the city. Locals had dropped off clothes, sneakers and backpacks.   
As two Chinese migrants‚Äîamong thousands who fled China this year‚Äîwalked out of the recreation center, one of them, Allen Jian, said that after traveling through eight different countries, paying ransom to kidnappers in Mexico to reach the U.S. border and hopping from one shelter to another in New York, he hasn‚Äôt regretted the decision to leave China.

"Only a fool believes that the Republican efforts to overturn Affirmative Action were truly about making things meritocratic.

Let's also not forget that [164 Republicans in the House voted against a resolution condemning hate crimes against Asian Americans in 2020](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/asian-americans-call-out-republicans-who-opposed-anti-racism-measure-n1240870), and [180 voted against it in 2021](https://americanindependent.com/house-republicans-anti-asian-hate-crimes-condemn-resolution-legislation-steve-scalise-grace-meng/).

The Democrats have a far from perfect record dealing with Asian Americans. Users here are 100% correct that Asians are completed ignored except when we're deemed politically advantageous (i.e., a prop against Trump during the Covid days), whereas black people are **always** at the forefront of the Democrat platform. Biden [was even the first president in decades to exclude any Asian Americans from his cabinet](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/27/biden-cabinet-asian-americans-left-out-top-leadership-team/4268739001/). It's frustrating as fuck, and even though I'm a staunch Democrat, I can understand why many of my fellow Asian Americans don't feel the same kind of loyalty.

[Ron DeSantis also signed a bill banning Chinese citizens from buying property in Florida](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/09/ron-desantis-bills-ban-chinese-citizens-buying-land-florida). No other country‚Äôs citizens are fully banned like that and it‚Äôs weird that‚Äôs not a bigger story. The Watters‚Äôs link tho is especially relevant now too as he just took over Tucker Carlson‚Äôs primetime slot on Fox. 

I also absolutely agree with you about democrats unfortunately dismissing the importance of Asian-American voters. I‚Äôve been able to watch a lot of local political organizing unfold over the years and it‚Äôs just a fact that republicans have at least made an effort for outreach in Asian-American communities. [The last few local elections have had Asian-American voters *drastically* shifting right in an extremely short time period](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/05/nyregion/election-asians-voting-republicans-nyc.html) which should be a huge red flag for the local democratic party to have taken notice of already. But unfortunately it‚Äôs an issue larger than just our local party‚Äôs failings; [the party as a whole was already told they‚Äôre making the same mistake](https://about.bgov.com/news/democrats-urge-party-to-engage-diverse-asian-american-community/) but for whatever reason I haven‚Äôt seen much being done at the national level either ([although Biden finally did nominate his first Asian-American cabinet member -in just March of this year](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/01/biden-nominates-asian-american-cabinet-secretary-julie-su)). 

The DNC is severely out of touch here but it‚Äôs also not even just an issue with them but unfortunately one I‚Äôve also noticed in the local activist community. Even tho I disagree vehemently with her politics I watched the rise of local rightwing activist Yiatin Chu and have to be impressed by how well shes been able to organize various local groups. While activists on the left aren‚Äôt really organizing well at all still. Having slight experience within the local activism world and the local politics world here I can say for a fact that if no one else has, I personally have been trying to stress to everyone that this is a growing demographic we can‚Äôt ignore. But in every conversation I‚Äôve had the problem always comes back to no one wants to change anything that they‚Äôre doing. Which doesn‚Äôt make sense to me either as that‚Äôs not really working but local democrats and activists are incredibly resistant to any change or new ideas. I completely agree this is  really bad but with the problem so large within the party I can‚Äôt in good conscience be too optimistic that much meaningful change will be made anytime soon. 

But even with all that you‚Äôre also still right that despite attempts at changing appearances republicans can‚Äôt be trusted to really be true allies. Particularly with local republicans and their issues with aligning with actual hate groups like

*Most people assume racism grows from a perception of human  difference: the fact of race gives rise to the practice of racism.  Sociologist Karen E. Fields and historian Barbara J. Fields argue  otherwise: the practice of racism produces the illusion of race, through  what they call ‚Äúracecraft.‚Äù And this phenomenon is intimately entwined  with other forms of inequality in American life. *

I'm extremely far from an expert on immigration policy, but I do read the news and feel like this is a pretty big oversimplification to put it lightly. 

From what I understand, Democrats (and blue ""states like ours"") have tried to pass immigration reform bills a few times over the past decade (under Obama and Biden). From what I also understand, Republicans have not been willing to compromise to put forward a bipartisan bill. When they had control of all both Congress and the White House, they were still not able to pass any serious reform. That had nothing to do with Democrats preventing them. Republicans didn't even get enough votes for a bill to pass in the House that both congressional leadership and Trump wanted passed. Something similar happened when Bush was President. There is not enough agreement among the GOP for them to pass a bill themselves.

[Here's a link](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/27/politics/house-immigration-bill-vote/index.html) that talks about that failed legislation, and how it failed due to internal disagreements within the GOP.

Here are a couple more articles about the past couple of decades and inaction on immigration.

yeah, but there should be no expectation they should shoulder a burden that the federal government should have prevented in the first place

better idea, rapid deportation and heavy disincentives for non-merit migration, public executions of all coyotes and smugglers

but what does the federal government do to help? Biden wants to rescind Title 42 and unleash a flood of migration into the US

second best option is to share the burden of these migrants with other states (especially virtue-signaling states like NY who perpetuate these problems with their open border politicians)

whatever help El Paso is getting from the feds is clearly not enough, hence why they had to bus a tiny fraction of their migrants somewhere else

Got banned from the DD Reddit for basically predicting that they would be the ones benefitting from the wage increase.

That being said, you're right. The VAST majority of people who are acting like it shouldn't affect average people aren't average people.  
They're almost always the preppy types that make $200k a year at some virtue signalling startup and never leave more than a 10 block radius from their gentrified enclaves.   


The people who actually NEED to tap into the city for resources... the working class, people who make middle and lower class incomes are the ones who are getting told they're on a waiting list for section 8.   


The easiest way to see how this system works against us is to go to the DMV.   
You need 6 ""points"" of ID, including birth certificates, Social Security cards, proof of address, etc.  
You ever check what you need if you're ""non-legal status""?  
A letter. That's it. A fucking letter... You can literally get an ID, which obviously opens up all kinds of other opportunities for you EASIER if you're someone who isn't a member of our system, than if you are.   


Most of these people have those IDNYC cards, some even have normal non-driver IDs by now.   
You WILL get turned away if your social security card's a little dusty.

Since 2014 or so, it's been trendy to just jump on these stupid bandwagons and NYC has been the posterchild for this nonsense.

"Here's another argument that pisses me off about this whole migrant thing ""oh they're desperate and they just want to live, they have no choice but to cross the borders illegally, they just want to work and have a better life.""  I call bullshit, maybe it's true for some.  But we all know why they keep forcing themselves into NYC, for free stuff.  They've been told not to come that we can't provide any support for them any more and yet they still insist on coming here and refusing to leave.  They've been offered a free plane ticket anywhere, they refuse to leave.  Anyone who's coming to legitimately work for a better life would be ready and willing to take any kinda job to work towards self sustainability.  And to be honest, most of these migrants can't even speak English nor have any sort of skillset that would immediately get them a high paying job that could afford them to live here in NYC.  So why do they refuse to leave to go to someplace else that possibly would have more opportunities than here.  This is also entirely unfair to the legitimate immigrants in the process of apply to come to this country legally, their immigration status is probably delayed by years because of this.  O they're trying to escape poverty, who the F in the world isn't trying to escape poverty.  Most people in the US are still trying to escape poverty!

Were we in a better economy and with fewer of them crossing the border, I wouldn't be so incensed by this.  Everyone's suffering not just the migrants.  Middle class people can barely afford to pay their rent and put food on the table.  The only ones not suffering are the 1%.",1702988374.0

They didn't get ANYTHING handed to them, normally stayed with family already here and most importantly, contributed to the system.

This isn't an issue with immigration- it's an issue of class.

"Will Work Permits Fix New York‚Äôs Migrant Crisis?

archive.md

Under the policy change announced last week, Venezuelans who arrived in the U.S. by July 31 will be eligible for a program known as Temporary Protected Status or TPS. It offers them deportation protections and the ability to work legally for at least 18 months.

But TPS might not prove the silver bullet New York was hoping for. Before this latest announcement, other applicants for TPS were waiting an average of 12 months to be granted their status and accompanying work permits, federal data show, raising the prospect of idle months before migrants can take advantage of the latest move. And though Venezuelans make up the largest contingent of migrants heading for New York, only about a quarter of the 60,000 currently in the city‚Äôs shelter system are Venezuelan, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams‚Äôs office confirmed.

Federal and state officials are also worried that the announcement of work permits could itself act as a draw for more migrants to cross the border illegally‚Äîand head for New York. That concern magnified in recent days when, just as officials were announcing the new program, a crush of Venezuelan migrants crossed all at once into the¬†tiny Texas border town of Eagle Pass, stretching that city‚Äôs processing and shelter capacity to a breaking point. Eagle Pass is also one of the pickup locations of the free buses that Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott runs¬†between the border and New York.

A further surge was Biden administration officials‚Äô precise fear when, month after month, they rebuffed¬†requests from Adams, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and other blue-state Democrats. Behind closed doors, the administration delivered the message: What you are asking for will only make the problem worse.

So the blue-state Democrats made their pleas increasingly public. Adams held a campaign-style rally last month where he featured several asylum seekers as speakers and implored the federal government with a chant: ‚ÄúLet them work!‚Äù

More than 100 members of Congress signed onto letters urging the move, and financial leaders including ‚Äôs Jamie Dimon and Google‚Äôs Sundar Pichai lobbied the White House.

Hochul paid the White House multiple visits but couldn‚Äôt secure a commitment. She kept up the pressure: in private meetings with senior White House aides, which the governor has described as ‚Äúloud,‚Äù and in a speech from the state capitol criticizing the administration.

‚ÄúWe heard you,‚Äù Biden ultimately whispered in Hochul‚Äôs ear ahead of the announcement, according to the governor, when they both attended a reception for the United Nations General Assembly at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

By Thursday, Biden was touting the decision in a speech at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute to loud cheers.

Critics of both New York and the Biden administration say their singular focus on work permits as a solution has allowed Democrats to skirt the thornier issue of calling for harsher border policies that would slow or even stop the flow of migrants heading to the U.S.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear the Democrats saying anything about stopping the flow by securing the border,‚Äù said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican representing Staten Island.

The work-permit news came as a welcome surprise to Beisys Romero Herrera, a 33-year-old Venezuelan woman who arrived in New York with her four boys a little under a year ago. They now live in a hotel-turned-shelter on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

Romero has been taking the occasional cleaning job and just recently bought an e-bike on credit from a neighbor, which she has been using to make food deliveries around the city, one of her children usually in tow. But the pay, about $100 a day so far, isn‚Äôt enough for Romero to move out of the shelter‚Äîand in any case most landlords won‚Äôt rent to her without a work permit.

Since April 2022, New York has received more than 115,000 migrants at its arrivals center in Midtown Manhattan looking for help. The resulting crisis has cost the city $2 billion so far, the mayor has said, and the federal government has only reimbursed a fraction of that cost. The Biden administration now says it needs Congress to authorize more funds before it can send New York or other cities more money.

That is how local officials became fixated on work permits as a solution. If migrants could immediately find above-the-board work‚Äîplugging existing labor shortages in industries such as hospitality‚Äîthey could move out of city-run shelters, relieving some of the financial strain.

The problem with their initial request, to expedite work permits for all asylum seekers, is that it is against the law. Under the existing process, migrants must first apply for asylum, a time-consuming process that most often requires help from a lawyer or advocate, and then wait an additional six months for a work permit. Advocates estimate that asylum seekers newly arriving in the U.S. should expect to wait a year or longer before they receive work authorization from the federal government.

That is why officials next focused on TPS as their best hope. When the government designates a country for TPS, meaning conditions are so dangerous there that its citizens can‚Äôt safely return home, the move automatically offers recipients work permits that can‚Äôt be challenged in court.

Department of Homeland Security officials have privately assured New York City that they hope to issue work permits to Venezuelans in a matter of weeks rather than months, according to federal and state officials familiar with the conversations, though they weren‚Äôt confident enough to make a public commitment to be speedy.

Now that they have gotten what they asked for, New York officials are realizing they still need a lot more help. They are lobbying the Biden administration to consider designating other countries for TPS, though no one country would have as much of an impact as Venezuela.

They have asked the White House to consider granting migrants humanitarian parole, another quasi-legal status that comes with a work permit. The administration has been granting the status for migrants who come through a legal path to the U.S., such as via an appointment at the border, but not for those who cross the border illegally.

And they have asked the administration to consider a more concerted resettlement strategy. Instead of allowing migrants to travel wherever they would like, overwhelmed city officials want the White House to actively pick destinations to spread them out across the country.

Mayling Martinez RaFermis Freites, a Venezuelan who arrived with her family in July, said she definitely plans to apply for TPS‚Äîit will be easier than putting in an application for asylum‚Äîbut said she doesn‚Äôt know how yet. Since coming to New York, Martinez said she hasn‚Äôt been able to find steady work that pays enough to also cover a babysitter.

‚ÄúIt will make things better, for sure, to be able to look for work,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to always live off the government in a hotel.‚Äù

On the other hand, people who want to blame TX for it, let's not forget the Federal government's been transporting migrants to San Diego, NJ, etc. AND non-profits from everywhere from TX to Colorado also provide transportation for migrants to go to whatever destination they want to go to, and of course, people know which states/places do this, and coyotes are pretty good at figuring this out and adjusting (all this info is freely available in open sources, it's not a secret), I think Abbots move was just the straw that broke the camel's back. 

I'm not trying to crap on NY, I think they should be free to do as they like, but just talking to people, and watching Spanish news and other sources out there (I'm a legal immigrant and fluent in Spanish), there's a lot more coming over and the TPS designation is not going to address the current issue or future ones.

"You didn‚Äôt even address my argument a little bit. Fake concern for immigrants? No that wasn‚Äôt my side of the debate. I‚Äôm self interested. I was talking about the effect of this immigration on the domestic working class. I work in construction. Not much English needed, and people come in with skills. There are many industries where immigrants can come in and be productive. These immigrants who are willing to live 10 to a bedroom are highly desirable employees. Domestic workers like me have ideas that annoy employers. The pesky idea that we do necessary work which is in some industries dangerous. So maybe we deserve compensation that provides for a decent life. Some guy who‚Äôs got family starving back home is gonna work real hard and not make trouble for the boss. Some guy who jus crossed the border isn‚Äôt very likely to say ‚Äúno boss that‚Äôs too dangerous‚Äù. They prob won‚Äôt be contacting osha. 

When you flood the market with this labor pool. The domestic labor pools bargaining power for wages is significantly lowered. The ability to say no to dangerous work is met with getting replaced by someone who‚Äôs used to life being cheap back home. Who‚Äôs used to employers being able to abuse them. If I die or lose a hand building your next apartment. My family will probably sue. But fortunately for the industry and it‚Äôs customers Latino immigrants aren‚Äôt a litigious bunch. Do you know how expensive it is when I see asbestos on a renovation and point it out? Bad for business. That asbestos was installed by guys from Ellis island, funny how things change but stay the same. 

I know the difference between being an employee with benefits and being a contractor. I value benefits. Newly arrived immigrants can‚Äôt afford to picky. The more of them that arrive, the less picky the rest of the labor pool gets to be. Not great for people who trust doctors more than gods plan. New immigrants from Latin America are religious bunch. 

I‚Äôm not special or unique. The country is full of people like me or many who have it much worse. The idea of democracy is that elected officials represent the interests and needs of the countries people. Prioritizing the needs of foreigners against popular opinion is an authoritarian standpoint. 

But ya it‚Äôs out of concern for immigrants. At a time where the megacorps who donate to the dnc are experiencing issues with the working class trying to organize into unions. The dnc is really concerned about the needs of foreigners. Who just so happen to provide cheap disposable labor. It just so happens to provide Union busting conditions, coincidentally offering a way for major companies to cut costs and see stock growth. Prob good for your 401k and keeping construction costs down. No I never voiced any concern, fake or otherwise for immigrants. Projection?. 

Fake empathy is a funny one. The dnc maintains sanction on Venezuela?

The republicans are real pieces of shit, but atleast they don‚Äôt gaslight me and call me racist for wanting a decent life. But ya I‚Äôm not gonna vote for a party that takes my money to bring in people to do my job for cheaper. Current polling shows I‚Äôm not very unique. But hey, who cares what Americans need? Ya you‚Äôre really doing gods work to bring people in that will get deported when immigration decides the election.

"My husband‚Äôs extended family, including himself, all immigrated between the 1950s and 1970s.  They proudly show off their old apartment buildings where they crammed into small apartments (usually inherited from a family member that moved up to a bigger one). They all started businesses and ended up with kids who attended college and professional schools (oddly the lawyers and the doctors never made as much $$$$ as they did but they appreciated the inheritances) and ended up doing fine.  A few started by pushing carts of leather goods near Delancey Street until they saved enough to open up retail stores.  One, ended up owning factories in Puerto Rico making prescription eyewear.  I think they had one weird advantage - hardly anyone else spoke their language - so they all had to learn to speak English.  It took awhile but they did.

My daughter‚Äôs roommates family is from El Salvador.  They started out in a small apartment too.  Own a diner, a house and are about to buy their first investment property to rent out.

There is so much unwarranted contempt for these people, yet so many are rightfully despondent, perhaps enough so to work very hard in cashless exchange for basic food and shelter.

Often conveniently ignored is the fact many are fleeing global-warming-related extreme weather events and chronic crop failures in the southern hemisphere widely believed to be related to the northern hemisphere‚Äôs chronic fossil-fuel burning, beginning with the Industrial Revolution.

Migrant laborers should be treated humanely, including timely access to proper work-related bodily protections, but too often are not.

If you ask most Texans about Abbott, as I have, most hate him like poison. They also dislike his bussing migrant policy. He's in power bc Republicans gerrymandered the fuck out of the state, among other factors. 

> The problem there is it requires the D‚Äôs to acknowledge their ‚Äúopen borders‚Äù policy is untenable.

Lol what open borders? Biden is as strict as Trump, if not moreso. 

The immigration system needs an overhaul for sure. ***AND SHUTTING THE SOUTHERN BORDER IS NOT A HUMANE OR PRACTICAL SOLUTION***. 

The problem is that, for whatever reason, Biden is leaving the city to fend for himself. Biden could easily
* Tell Abbott and DeSantis to stop intruding in federal immigration procedures or else
* Compel Abbott and DeSantis to communicate and collaborate with NYC and other places that they're sending migrants to
* Divert fed border money from Texas and Florida to NYC, who's doing the work that those states refuse to do

As I've said for months, the whole point of the bussing was to catch the city on the backfoot and push it into collapse. It was bad faith behavior from the beginning. Idk why city leaders continue to bite their tongue when this is as plain as day. 

> As someone who deals w NYC agencies every day‚Ä¶.HUGE CUTS in services are coming

This is true. And again, ultimately this is the result of the feds refusing to act. And glaring inefficiencies in the current city procedures. For example, surely there are cheaper ways to house the migrants than in hotels. 

> I know life long NY Dems who are flipping‚Ä¶it‚Äôs happening. People have had enough.

>Between 2019 and 2020, the number of New Yorkers earning between $150,000 and $750,000 fell by nearly 6%, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office.

>Moreover, the number of real high earners ‚Äî those making over $750,000 ‚Äî dropped by nearly 10% during the same period.

>Some speculate that the wealthy elites are leaving New York because of the state‚Äôs high tax rates. While it‚Äôs hard to say exactly why people move, the loss of high earners can impact the city‚Äôs income tax revenue.

>**For perspective, the 41,000 filers in the city‚Äôs top 1% pay more than 40% of all its income taxes. The 450,000 filers in the top 10% pay about two-thirds of all income taxes.**

>**In other words, the remaining 90% of taxpayers contribute about one-third of the city‚Äôs income tax revenue.**

>In its most recent report, financial technology company SmartAsset found that in 2020, New York had a net outflow of almost 20,000 high-earning households ‚Äî defined as households earning over $200,000. That was more than any state in the study.

Keep in mind, this is NYPost trying to squeeze maximum rage.  So lets say that a family of four gets 1000.  They won't, but we'll say they do.  That's $250 a person, that's less than $10 a meal.  It's $2.77 per individual meal, not exactly luxury.  


Now, it seems like it's costing the city roughly $11 per meal to feed these people shitty meals using catering services right now.  That's $33 per day.  $990 per month.  It's almost $4000 a month for a family of 4.  


This is actually going to cut costs by 75% if it works as described.  For 500 people, it's going to save like $370k a month just for the pilot.  For 15k people, it would save $11m a month.  $132m a year.

Yes, the per meal cost, at first blush, looks cheaper the way they‚Äôve been doing it. But the food is tremendously shitty, often rotten, and so a lot of those meals end up in a dumpster. So that $11 is going straight into the trash. Moreover, all that money is shoveled to some corrupt food services company that most likely has at least a few politicians in their pocket. 

Contrast that with providing cards migrant families can actually use for any food they can buy through the city. Now, that money isn‚Äôt wasted, families can actually get food they can eat.

Because New York City, like other major urban areas, often lacked basic services, **the Tweed Ring provided these for the price of a vote, or several votes.** Tweed made sure the immigrants had jobs, found a place to live, had enough food, received medical care, and even had enough coal money to warm their apartments during the cold of winter. In addition, he contributed millions of dollars to the institutions that benefited and cared for the immigrants, such as their neighborhood churches and synagogues, Catholic schools, hospitals, orphanages, and charities. When dilapidated tenement buildings burned down, ring members followed the firetrucks to ensure that families had a place to stay and food to eat.

https://billofrightsinstitute.org/essays/william-boss-tweed-and-political-machines

Although Boss Tweed and Tammany Hall engaged in corrupt politics, they undoubtedly helped the immigrants and poor of the city in many ways. Thousands of recent immigrants in New York were naturalized as American citizens and adult men had the right to vote. Because New York City, like other major urban areas, often lacked basic services, **the Tweed Ring provided these for the price of a vote, or several votes.** Tweed made sure the immigrants had jobs, found a place to live, had enough food, received medical care, and even had enough coal money to warm their apartments during the cold of winter. In addition, he contributed millions of dollars to the institutions that benefited and cared for the immigrants, such as their neighborhood churches and synagogues, Catholic schools, hospitals, orphanages, and charities. When dilapidated tenement buildings burned down, ring members followed the firetrucks to ensure that families had a place to stay and food to eat. Immigrants in New York were grateful for the much-needed services from the city and private charities. The Tweed Ring seemed to be creating a healthier society, and in overwhelming numbers, **immigrants happily voted for the Democrats who ran the city.**",1706907338.0

The GOP voted it down because Biden is trying to tie Ukraine/Israel funding for wars to the border instead of just doing a separate border deal. So he's basically using the border funding as leverage to fund two wars in the tune of hundreds of billions $.

Plus, under the border plan by Biden, they'll allow 1.8 million individuals to cross annually before deciding to do anything.

""Biden is referencing an expulsion authority being negotiated by the lawmakers that would automatically kick in on days when illegal crossings reached more than 5,000 over a five-day average across the Southern border, which is currently seeing as many as 10,000 crossings per day.""

"The courts are overwhelmed with eviction cases but it does not affect their workload. They simply spread it out further. The only people being screwed over are landlords.

I personally know people (friends and family) who have been financially devastated by malicious tenants who play the system and took years to evict. These tenants would do things like show up to court with no attorney and request one when the judge asks them to delay for several more months or reset the case by trying to sneak in a few hundred dollars through Zelle or Venmo which would count as rent payment unless the landlord notices and returns it to the tenant immediately.  In most cases, these human cockroaches also hold the property hostage and demand large sums $30,000+ as a settlement for them to move out immediately if the landlord wants to skip the lengthy legal procedures. In one case, it took almost 3 years and the apartment was trashed by the tenants after and in another case, the landlord ended up opting for the settlement to avoid years of headache and bigger financial loss after months of battling in court. 

For legislation to work in evicting, the bill must include a redefinition of ""squatters"". Something like ""a legal tenant who has been unable to pay the agreed upon monthly rent for more than 3 months"". Since courts are so backed up and extend these no-payment periods for years, there should be a clause about allowing landlords to request law enforcement to immediately evict the squatters without delay if an attorney could present that the tenants have violated the law.",1712158661.0

Market rate apartments are rented out for the maximum people are willing to pay to live there, and if all the stabilized units because market rate they‚Äôd all just start costing the same as what market rate apartments already go for.

For example, if you have a landlord with 10 units where 5 are stabilized at $2k and the other 5 are market rate at $4k. Those market rate units are not $4k because the landlord is raising rent to recoup any costs or loss of income on the stabilized units, they‚Äôre being rented out for $4k because that‚Äôs the highest people are willing to pay to live there. If all 10 units became market rate they would become 10 $4k apartments, not 10 $3k apartments.

You're right.

Since you're stuck on the semantics of ""line"", use the word ""process"" instead.

There is a *process* for legal immigration, and it makes little sense that, for instance, an educated Peruvian national who wants to legally live and work in America has to hope to get chosen via DV lottery while another Peruvian can go to the southern border and claim asylum and be allowed into the US and fast-tracked to live and work here, even if their claim is dubious and years out from being heard.

Making educated, skilled immigrants from one country take their chances on a lottery to come here while unskilled laborers are allowed in is great for employers like gig economy firms that are constantly seeking a race to the bottom when it comes to pay, but is not a net-benefit to the country in the long run.

Of course the counterpoint here is that it should be easier for the educated, skilled immigrants to come here. And that is true.

It doesn't matter if you paid McDonalds workers $50 and gave them 5 weeks of vacation, the vast majority of people in developed countries don't want to do that kind of job.

It is easier (in terms of number of years) to make $100K as a truck/delivery driver than at a corporate office job. Yet, very few people are willing to become truck drivers in America nowadays. 

Living conditions have improved so quickly that even well paying but physically laborous jobs are now disregarded by most of the population.

Yeah those ungrateful Americans want to make a livable wage while illegal immigrants are *happy*( literally have no other choice and no ground to ask for better because they are being exploited and can be deported ) making any money at all. Those lazy American fucks even have the audacity to want **3%** of the year in vacation time while, i bet they arent even working 80 hours a week.

"you're assuming we can have the cake and eat it too. if min wage and workers ""rights"" (which are actually very regressive and hurt the economy but whatever) were strictly enforced, then immigrants would have no reason to come to america because no one would hire them when they have to pay them the same as an american. its either we have strong workers ""rights"" (high min wage, mandated sick leave, mandated healthcare) for low skill workers OR we get immigrants to do those jobs. Can't have both.


the only reason this kind of migration happens in america is because we are the only western country that doesnt have such inflated min wage laws and we also dont police illegal immigration nearly as much as other countries. other western countries mandate that their bottom of the barrel skillless citizens be paid bullshit inflated wages, and they are far stricter on immigration so companies cant circumvent that and hire immigrants who accept being paid less (while at the same time doing a better job). ironically, the fact that they have laws that mandate higher pay than us is WHY their economies are so much weaker than ours. 

america would be so much poorer if we actually HAD to hire americans to do all our low wage labor jobs. all of our food, clothes, and services would double or triple in price, which would lower disposable income which would slow down the economy. when you pay 2-3x for something made in America, you're just paying for the increased cost of labor, not a superior quality product. american/western labor is expensive, regardless of skill level. In order to pay an American to stand at a construction site and hold a sign (literally a job a monkey could do), youd have to give them $22 an hour + medical + sick time. immigrant would be happy to do that for $10, and that would benefit our economy alot more. 

low skill jobs deserve less pay. paying them more doesnt mean getting more value or performance from the worker like it does with high skilled jobs. pay an engineer more and he'll write better code which will save/make you more money. pay a laborer more and you'll only lose profit. 

hiring american = paying 3x for the same shit = less money to circulate = less tax revenue = weaker economy. its why in countries like australia or canada where McDonalds workers make $19 but office workers make 1/2 to 1/3 our office workers.",1692946582.0

> Our laws arent strict enough actually. Because employers are brazenly breaking them and exploiting migrant workers with absolutely no penalty, and even if they do get caught its the migrant worker that faces the real punishment while the business gets a slap on the wrist and promises to be a good business next time.

My entire point is that if you make the laws stricter, you hurt the migrants. Making it harder for companies to hire migrant workers = they'll just hire Americans. I say again, making it so that a migrant worker needs to be paid the same and have the same benefits as an American citizen means the migrant wont even get the job. Liberals always have these ideas with good intentions but bad effects. 

> literally have no other choice and no ground to ask for better because they are being exploited and can be deported

No, they're genuinely happy. I'm an immigrant. Immigrants from my country and other poor countries would kill to be ""exploited"" (aka get paid $12 an hour to make coffee (aka make more than 90% of people in their home country lmao)). You are looking at this from the perspective of a Westerner who already enjoys a superior quality of life. Immigrants from developing countries are happy to have a lower quality of life than you, because its still a far far far better quality of life than what they are used to. *failing to understand this can lead to supporting very bad policy decisions that will harm the migrants, not help them*

 > ""Why, as a business owner, should I have to obey the law when there are exploitable migrants around?""

Why, as a business owner, would I hire someone who knows no english when i can hire an english speaking American? If you make the pay and benefits the same for migrants and Americans, then ability to speak english is the only differentiator. It would therefore make no sense for any business to hire migrants if they aren't any cheaper, just more difficult to work with due to lack of english skills.

> Maybe a business should go bankrupt if they literally can't afford to pay their workers the legal minimum since their business isnt even close to being successful?

Or...maybe the government shouldnt have such stringent laws that are anti-business and anti-economic growth. It's a pretty dumb argument. If we made min wage $100/hr every business would go bankrupt.

Here is the unvarnished reality and why we must cut funding in some areas:

-The city is spending about [$390 per migrant per day](https://www.fox5ny.com/news/nyc-cost-per-single-migrant).

600 people are arriving EVERY DAY. (Straight from the [city](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/780-23/as-number-asylum-seekers-city-s-care-tops-64-100-city-additional-policies-for#:~:text=The%20city%20has%20made%20every,is%20full%20and%20past%20its)). 

That's about $234,000 just to care for one days worth of migrants. The federal government is barely helping or even acknowledging this reality. 

There are about 120 thousand migrants using city resources in some form. (That excludes the 80 thousand resident homeless people).

This is an enormous amount of money. And top it off tax revenues are declining in the midst of all this. It's just totally unacceptable and unsustainable. What about our native population?!",1714248771.0

Taken together, they will amount to billions of dollars in cuts that could affect a wide range of basic services, including schools as well as police, fire and sanitation services, according to the mayor‚Äôs office‚Ä¶

"I voted for Katherine Garcia not Adams, but you guys are missing the critical point. As a right to shelter city, we are legally bound to providing shelter to anyone that arrives to NYC homeless. This is court imposed so there‚Äôs no mayor that would have been able to avoid this.

In other words, if the rapid inflow of migrants doesn‚Äôt stop, we will be forced into increasingly more onerous shelter costs. Eventually we‚Äôll burn through all the low cost sheltering options and be forced to use more hotels and more outdoor space. 

Now the question is what do we do with the ballooning and mandatory migrant shelter costs? We either significantly raise taxes, significantly cut and redirect spending, convince the courts to release the city from the right to shelter requirements, or do some combination of all three. 

Adams, for all his BS, is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Look at how other cities are handling the situation. Chicago is housing migrants in police stations at such large numbers that residents are having trouble using the stations.

I think it would have been politically smarter and more equitable to propose a tax surcharge on affluent New Yorkers tax to help pay for migrant shelters.

"I don't understand this.  

I had an apartment on 38th and 3rd.  During COVID, the mayor decided it would be a good idea to convert unused hotels all over the city.  

My neighborhood for over a decade became an issue almost overnight.  I saw multiple reports of rape, robbery, and more being reported from buildings on the surrounding blocks.  Every time the story hit the news, it showed that the perps were from these hotels.  My GF was harassed every time she had to walk from the parking garage to my building at night.  The last straw for me was when a woman rushed past the doorman and broke into my apartment.  I moved out a year later.

I was homeless when I was 14.  I went to Covenant House, a homeless shelter for teens in Time Square.  But I didn't care that it was in the middle of the city.  I would have gone there if it was in Queens, upstate, or elsewhere.

WHY does NYC need to provide housing inside the busiest city in America?  Why can't it be in the outer boroughs or upstate?  I paid a buttload to live in the middle of the city and I had friends who couldn't afford that rent, having to deal with commuting from Brooklyn/Queens daily.  Why endanger the business center of NY State, where every sq foot is a valuable resource and push businesses to relocate to other states to keep their workers safe?

WHY PROVIDE HOUSING IN MANHATTAN??

We didn't do this for the same reason NYC isn't solving the problem: The issue is the US setting these countries up for privatization, hence extraction of their resources. US intervention isn't focused on building countries or providing jobs for locals; it's focused on making the political structure of a country hospitable for privatization through foreign (US) capital (ie. setting up Shell facilities and McDonald's).

Everyone has to make a buck, and as a result actual issues aren't addressed, but the people paid to address them are still paid. The solution would be to allow government in these countries (and our own) to solve these problems through tax dollars and without private entities. Employ and train locals to fix these issues.

And we shouldn't be discouraging migrants. All other developed nations are having an issue with shrinking populations, and the US has mitigated this through immigration. The focus should be making a robust system that helps migrants get on their feet and become productive as quickly as possible... which is a function of the government.

"Yup, here ya go:

Agents from the Federal Bureau of  Investigation on Thursday searched the Brooklyn home of Mayor Eric  Adams‚Äôs chief fund-raiser, Brianna Suggs, a campaign consultant who is  deeply entwined with efforts to advance the mayor‚Äôs agenda, according to  two people with knowledge of the matter.

The raid apparently  prompted Mr. Adams to abruptly cancel several meetings scheduled for  Thursday morning in Washington, D.C., to talk to White House officials  and members of Congress about the influx of migrants in New York and  other major cities. Instead, he hurriedly returned to New York ‚Äúto deal  with a matter,‚Äù a spokesman for the mayor said.

Ms. Suggs, who  could not immediately be reached for comment, is an essential cog in Mr.  Adams‚Äôs fund-raising machine, which has already raised more than $2.5  million for his 2025 re-election campaign.

A third person with  knowledge of the raid said agents from one of the public corruption  squads in the F.B.I.‚Äôs New York office questioned Ms. Suggs during the  search of her home.

An F.B.I. spokesman confirmed that  ‚Äúwe are at that location carrying out law enforcement action,‚Äù referring  to Ms. Suggs‚Äôs home in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. 

Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor‚Äôs office in Manhattan, declined to comment.

Charles Kretchmer Lutvak, a spokesman for Mr. Adams, denied any knowledge of the raid.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not aware of that,‚Äù Mr. Lutvak said.

He  added that Ms. Suggs was not an employee of City Hall and referred  calls to the mayor‚Äôs campaign team. Evan Thies, a campaign spokesman for  Mr. Adams, did not immediately respond to multiple calls and texts  seeking comment.

In the past two years, Mr. Adams‚Äôs re-election  campaign has paid Ms. Suggs nearly $100,000 for fund-raising and  campaign consulting services via her company, Suggs Solutions, according  to city records.

His first mayoral campaign paid her more than $50,000.

Ms.  Suggs has also registered as a lobbyist. State records indicate that a  real estate concern hired Ms. Suggs, via an intermediary, to lobby the  mayor‚Äôs office and the New York City Council on its behalf in 2022.

Ms.  Suggs worked as an aide to Mr. Adams when he was Brooklyn borough  president, and Ingrid Lewis-Martin ‚Äî currently the mayor‚Äôs top adviser ‚Äî  was his deputy.

Ms. Suggs is also deeply embedded in outside efforts to advance the mayor‚Äôs agenda. A key ally‚Äôs political action committee, [Striving for a Better New York,](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/02/nyregion/eric-adams-pac-cockfield.html) that promised to support state candidates aligned with Mr. Adams on policy matters, has paid Ms. Suggs roughly $100,000.

Mr.  Adams‚Äôs decision to cancel high-level meetings with senior White House  officials about an issue he has warned will hollow out New York‚Äôs budget  and destroy the city suggested an unusual level of urgency.

The  mayor was scheduled to meet with representatives from Congress along  with the mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, and the mayor of Denver,  Mike Johnston.

Mr. Adams [posted a video on X](https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1720043365465575577),  formerly known as Twitter, Thursday morning of himself sitting aboard  an airplane. He said he was heading to Washington to meet with White  House officials and members of the congressional delegation about the  migrant crisis, which he described as a ‚Äúreal issue.‚Äù

Mr.  Adams promised to keep the public updated throughout the day, but after  he canceled the meetings, officials at City Hall would not explain why.

‚ÄúThe  mayor is returning to New York City to address a matter,‚Äù Mr. Lutvak,  the mayor‚Äôs spokesman, said in an email when asked why Mr. Adams was  suddenly returning to the city. ‚ÄúThese meetings will be rescheduled as  soon as possible.‚Äù

Asked whether the matter was a personal issue or related to City Hall, officials refused to elaborate.

‚ÄúHe is returning to deal with a matter,‚Äù Mr. Lutvak said.",1698943818.0

U.S. Investigating Whether Adams Received Illegal Donations From Turkey
A raid at the home of Eric Adams‚Äôs chief fund-raiser was part of an inquiry into whether foreign money was funneled into his mayoral campaign, a search warrant shows.

By William K. Rashbaum, Dana Rubinstein and Jeffery C. Mays

Updated 8:21 p.m. ET
Federal prosecutors and the F.B.I. are conducting a broad public corruption investigation into whether Mayor Eric Adams‚Äôs 2021 election campaign conspired with the Turkish government to receive illegal foreign donations, according to a search warrant obtained by The New York Times.

The investigation burst into public view on Thursday when federal agents conducted an early-morning raid at the Brooklyn home of the mayor‚Äôs chief fund-raiser, Brianna Suggs. Ms. Suggs is a campaign consultant who is deeply entwined with efforts to advance the mayor‚Äôs agenda.

Investigators also sought to learn more about the potential involvement of a Brooklyn construction company with ties to Turkey, as well as a small university in Washington, D.C., that also has ties to the country and to Mr. Adams.

According to the search warrant, investigators were also focused on whether the mayor‚Äôs campaign kicked back benefits to the construction company‚Äôs officials and employees, and to Turkish officials.

The agents seized three iPhones and two laptop computers, along with papers and other evidence, including something agents identified as ‚Äúmanila folder labeled Eric Adams,‚Äù seven ‚Äúcontribution card binders‚Äù and other materials, according to the documents.

There was no indication that the investigation was targeting the mayor, and he is not accused of wrongdoing. Yet the raid apparently prompted him to abruptly cancel several meetings scheduled for Thursday morning in Washington, D.C., where he planned to speak with White House officials and members of Congress about the migrant crisis.

Instead, he hurriedly returned to New York ‚Äúto deal with a matter,‚Äù a spokesman for the mayor said.

Appearing at a D√≠a de Muertos celebration at Gracie Mansion on Thursday night, Mr. Adams defended his campaign, saying that he held it ‚Äúto the highest ethical standards.‚Äù

He said he had not been contacted by any law enforcement officials, but pledged to cooperate in any inquiry. Mr. Adams said that he returned from Washington to be ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù to ‚Äúlook at this inquiry‚Äù as it unfolded.",1698979142.0

The warrant suggested that some of the foreign campaign contributions were made as part of a straw donor scheme, where donations are made in the names of people who did not actually give money. Investigators sought evidence to support potential charges that included the theft of federal funds and conspiracy to steal federal funds, wire fraud and wire fraud conspiracy, as well as campaign contributions by foreign nationals and conspiracy to make such contributions.

Mr. Adams has boasted of his ties to Turkey, most recently during a flag-raising he hosted for the country in Lower Manhattan last week. The mayor said that there were probably no other mayors in New York City history who had visited Turkey as frequently as he has.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm on my sixth or seventh visit,‚Äù he said. At least one of those visits happened while he was Brooklyn borough president, when the government of Turkey underwrote the excursion, The Daily News reported.

Ms. Suggs, who could not be reached for comment, is an essential cog in Mr. Adams‚Äôs fund-raising machine, which has already raised more than $2.5 million for his 2025 re-election campaign.

A person with knowledge of the raid said agents from one of the public corruption squads in the F.B.I.‚Äôs New York office questioned Ms. Suggs during the search of her home.

An F.B.I. spokesman confirmed that ‚Äúwe are at that location carrying out law enforcement action,‚Äù referring to Ms. Suggs‚Äôs home in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn.

The agents also served Ms. Suggs with a subpoena directing her to testify before a federal grand jury hearing evidence in Manhattan.

Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor‚Äôs office in Manhattan, declined to comment.

The construction company was identified in the warrant, portions of which were obtained by The Times, as KSK Construction Group in Brooklyn. Individuals who listed their employer as KSK donated nearly $14,000 to Mr. Adams‚Äôs 2021 campaign, according to campaign finance records. A person who answered the telephone at the company declined to comment.

Charles Kretchmer Lutvak, a spokesman for Mr. Adams, said Ms. Suggs was not an employee of City Hall and referred calls to the mayor‚Äôs campaign team.

‚ÄúThe campaign has always held itself to the highest standards,‚Äù said Vito Pitta, a lawyer for Mr. Adams‚Äôs 2021 and 2025 campaigns. ‚ÄúThe campaign will of course comply with any inquiries, as appropriate.‚Äù

Mr. Pitta added: ‚ÄúMayor Adams has not been contacted as part of this inquiry.‚Äù

The search warrant sought financial records for Ms. Suggs and any entity controlled or associated with her; documents related to contributions to the mayor‚Äôs 2021 campaign; records of travel to Turkey by any employee, officer or associate of the campaign; and documents related to interactions between the campaign and the government of Turkey, ‚Äúincluding persons acting at the behest of the Turkish government.‚Äù

Investigators specified documents relating to Bay Atlantic University, a tiny Turkish-owned institution that opened in Washington, D.C., in 2014. The following year, Mr. Adams visited one of the school‚Äôs sister universities in Istanbul, where he was given various certificates and was told that a scholarship would be created in his name.

The warrant also sought electronic devices, including cellphones, laptops or tablets used by Ms. Suggs.

Ms. Suggs, 25, is the latest in a series of individuals tied to Mr. Adams who have attracted interest from law enforcement, including several connected to the mayor‚Äôs fund-raising efforts.

In September, Eric Ulrich, Mr. Adams‚Äôs former buildings commissioner and senior adviser, was indicted by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, on 16 felony charges, including counts of conspiracy and bribetaking. Mr. Ulrich, as well as three others indicted at the time, helped organize a 2021 fund-raiser for Mr. Adams.

In July, Mr. Bragg indicted six individuals, including a retired police inspector who once worked and socialized with Mr. Adams, on charges of conspiring to funnel illegal donations to the mayor‚Äôs 2021 campaign.",1698979259.0

The Department of Investigation is also investigating the role of one of the mayor‚Äôs top aides in a violent altercation last month at a migrant center in Manhattan.

Mr. Adams has tried to distance himself from these inquiries, arguing that he had limited insight into the events that precipitated them. But the investigation of such a close and longtime adviser might be harder to keep at arm‚Äôs length.


In the past two years, Mr. Adams‚Äôs re-election campaign has paid Ms. Suggs nearly $100,000 for fund-raising and campaign consulting services via her company, Suggs Solutions, according to city records.

His first mayoral campaign paid her more than $50,000.

Ms. Suggs has also registered as a lobbyist. State records indicate that the East Broadway Mall, a Chinatown real estate concern, hired Ms. Suggs, via an intermediary, to lobby the mayor‚Äôs office and the City Council on its behalf in 2022.

Ms. Suggs worked as an aide to Mr. Adams when he was Brooklyn borough president, and is particularly close with Ingrid Lewis-Martin, who was his deputy at the time and is currently his top adviser.

Ms. Suggs is deeply embedded in outside efforts to advance the mayor‚Äôs agenda. A key ally‚Äôs political action committee, Striving for a Better New York, which promised to support state candidates aligned with Mr. Adams on policy matters, has paid Ms. Suggs roughly $100,000.


Ms. Suggs also lists the Brooklyn Democratic Party, with which Mr. Adams has close ties, as a client on her LinkedIn page.

Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, the assemblywoman who leads the Brooklyn party, said Ms. Suggs was a volunteer fund-raiser who mainly handled logistics. She said she was surprised to learn of the F.B.I. raid.

‚ÄúWhat I know of Brianna Suggs, she‚Äôs a bright young lady. I think she‚Äôs a very honest person, organized. She‚Äôs very mild-mannered, a very professional person,‚Äù Ms. Bichotte Hermelyn said. ‚ÄúShe knows the rules.‚Äù

Mr. Adams‚Äôs decision to cancel high-level meetings with senior White House officials about an issue that he has warned will hollow out New York‚Äôs budget and destroy the city suggested an unusual level of urgency.


The White House appeared to have been taken by surprise. The mayor‚Äôs office called Thursday morning to inform them of the cancellation, a White House aide said.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak to his schedule and why he had to, he could not attend,‚Äù said Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary.

The mayor was scheduled to meet with representatives from Congress along with the mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, and the mayor of Denver, Mike Johnston.

At 7:41 a.m. Thursday, Mr. Adams posted a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, of himself sitting aboard an airplane. He said he was heading to Washington to meet with White House officials and members of the congressional delegation about the migrant crisis, which he described as a ‚Äúreal issue.‚Äù
The mayor promised to keep the public updated throughout the day, but after he canceled the meetings, officials at City Hall would not explain why. They said the meetings would be rescheduled.

By 8 a.m. Thursday, around 10 agents could be seen standing on Ms. Suggs‚Äôs block, according to a video of the scene taken by a neighbor and viewed by The New York Times. One agent wore a light green tactical vest with the letters ‚ÄúF.B.I.‚Äù stamped on the back. Another official could be seen leaving the apartment with a cardboard box.

Ms. Suggs was standing on the stoop with her father as the agents searched her home, according to the neighbor, Christopher Burwell.

‚ÄúWhatever it is, she must have been tricked into it, because she‚Äôs a great woman,‚Äù Mr. Burwell said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known her all my life.‚Äù

There's around 11,000 firefighters in total and I have no clue how many live in the City but I doubt it's much more than half. Then once you subtract the ones who aren't registered Democrats you're down to a very insignificant number. Probably, at absolute most, like 8-10k of Adams' almost 405k votes. And that's assuming every single cop and firefighter who's a Democrat voted for him, which obviously wouldn't be the case.",1699072061.0

"I don't think so. The NYPD has long hated him because he rose to prominence in the 90s by publicly calling the NYPD racist. Prior to the election, the people at the highest levels of the department were publicly saying they think there's too much bad blood between him and the NYPD for them to ever have a good working relationship with him. He's on the record as saying he thinks an NYPD officer tried to assassinate him in the 90s as a result of him continuously calling them out. He only started to lean into him being an ex-cop to try to get some ""tough on crime"" votes.

Even still though, all of the cop unions declined to endorse him. The captain's union, which he was a member of, endorsed Yang instead, as did the detective's union. The closest he got to an endorsement from any of them was the PBA urging their members to only rank Adams, Garcia and Yang because they were the only ones who ""WOULDN'T DEFUND THE POLICE!!!!"" 

""The NYPD loves Eric Adams"" is mostly a Reddit narrative because people think they must since he was once a cop and so they never bother to actually look into it. In reality though they think he's a traitor who broke the ""blue wall of silence."" 

Regardless though, only registered Democrats are allowed to vote in the Democratic primary so any non-Democrat cops/firefighters would have been boxed out of voting for him even if they wanted to.",1699129149.0

"The City actually started construction on a subway from Brooklyn to Staten Island like 100 years ago and then promptly abandoned it, never to revisit it.

To answer your question though, sorta. But it's more about shifting demographics. The whole City used to be dominated by loud, angry, relatively conservative blue collar white people with thick accents. That was the whole stereotype of what a New Yorker was for decades (think Archie Bunker). They've been slowly dying off and moving out the City for like 70 years now but especially over the last 50 years. Staten Island is just the last borough left where they make up a sizable portion of the population. 

That's been changing over the last few decades, just not as quickly as it did in the other boroughs and a big part of that is the lack of public transit options to Manhattan. It's historically made new arriving immigrants looking to work in Manhattan hesitant to settle on SI. That's been changing a bit too though as Staten Island and Brooklyn now have similar Asian and Hispanic populations (as respective portions of their overall populations).

Ironically, a lot of those aforementioned type of white people who left Brooklyn moved to Staten Island which also greatly slowed down its demographic shift. The island's population has more than doubled since the Verrazzano Bridge opened in the mid-60s.",1697564204.0

The issue is Manhattan is absolutely demolishing the rest of the city in contribution to services ratio (no surprise), making up like 70+% of the tax base.

Staten Island gets the short end of the stick time and again, and is only important when the city wants to implement new rules/things that can make them money.

"Not at all true - there are many cases where the intervening countries are not safe enough. Someone who was persecuted in Guatemala for refusing to pay money to the Sinaloa cartel would obviously be much safer claiming asylum in the US (or in Canada) than in Mexico, even though Guatemala borders Mexico and not the US.

Even aside from that, nothing about either international or US asylum law requires people to claim asylum in the first country or even the first safe country they reach, outside of a bilateral agreement between the US and Canada that applies in some but not all cases. The EU has a ""first EU country reached"" asylum agreement among themselves similar to what the US and Canada have, but those are regional exceptions and not a default rule. Even for the EU, if someone goes through multiple non-EU countries on their way to the EU, the EU's agreement does not force them to leave the EU to pursue their asylum claim.

Asylum claimants in the US who don't qualify for asylum or another way to stay will eventually get deported, whether or not the US is the first country they entered after leaving their country of origin. But if someone clearly doesn't qualify for asylum and wants to sneak into the US illegally, they will probably be hiding from DHS instead of explicitly announcing themselves with an asylum claim. So I expect that most of the claimants have at least plausible enough claims that with a good lawyer they wouldn't be laughed out of immigration court, and that a fair fraction of them will be approved.

Then you might mention that thanks to an aging population and low birth rates combined with increased higher education levels, America is facing a critical labor shortage that we need migrants to fill, at which point they'll insist that migrants are taking jobs away from good hard-working Americans despite unemployment rates being lower and wages generally being higher in areas friendly to migrants.

"Bro, you've moved the goalposts from:

 ""Nobody who traverses multiple countries, passes right on by to continue to the US is seeking asylum ""

to:  ""A fraction of these people will qualify for asylum"", then call what is literally legal ""technically legal"" and ""a loophole"".

Point is, asylum, and the search for a better life is something that's common in lots of immigration stories. 

We have midtown hotel stays, free meals, healthcare because we have a modern welfare system. 

People literally suffered in squalor due to the lack of those resources, and donations did not provide equal to the level of demand, hence the creation of the welfare systems. Now, we can provide resources so people do not have to live like that. 

But according to you, ""It'S A LoOpHoLe"", despite literally being legally enshrined as something people can and do qualify for. 

The discussion people are arguing with you on here is your statement "" Nobody who traverses multiple countries, passes right on by to continue  to the US is seeking asylum - they‚Äôre just exploiting a loophole.""

People can, and do pass right on by into the US through asylum claims that were approved REGARDLESS of the person's nation of origin's distance from the US. 

Regarding that, you're wrong. You then go on to talk about migrants who are here today, as a part of this recent influx. Just because they ""have laughably low numbers of accepted claims"" doesn't mean a claim is just accepted through technical loopholes.

Now, if you're talking about the ""you have to enter the US to apply for asylum"", that's still a part of the law, and not necessarily a loophole. Some people do indeed stay here, and have their claims accepted, after traveling past several countries. You can criticise those who apply and know they won't qualify, to illegally immigrate, but your initial reply sounds like it lumps in all asylum seekers, and suggests that their claims shouldn't be accepted, even if they can qualify and be approved. 

Either way, we've seen what happens when you have refugees who seek entry be auto-rejected and sent back. Boats of Jews fled Europe as the Nazis gained power. They were rejected from the region they desired to migrate to. Boats went back with those people, and some died in the holocaust, when they could have been safe from it.",1695402666.0
"> The difference between your ancestors and the arriving masses is that your ancestors got nothing for coming here - no Midtown hotel stays, no free meals, no free healthcare. If we‚Äôre going back to that, that at least would be an improvement. They came and didn‚Äôt have their hands out as of day 1.

They also were probably allowed to work from day 1. Under current immigration law, that's illegal for asylum claimants until they receive subsequent permission that takes many months to obtain. Are you proposing to allow asylum claimants to work the moment they enter the country in exchange for banning them from government assistance? If they won't have their important bills paid by the government, they need to be able to work legally to pay those bills.

Also, how do you suggest to handle asylum claimants who are genuinely fleeing persecution but unable to work, or at least initially unable to cover the high cost of US health insurance premiums and US healthcare without assistance? Someone who has just been persecuted pogrom-style probably needs urgent mental healthcare at the very least, and maybe physical healthcare if they were beaten or worse, before being able to work productively, and probably won't have been able to flee with much savings.

> And yes it‚Äôs a loophole because the assessment of their claims takes years to be verified - some cases took 10 years. 

So why not add funding to the immigration court system to bring that down to 1-2 years, and let them work in the community in the meantime? Honestly, reducing adjudication backlogs sounds like a great way to reduce abuse of the asylum system. Anyone currently faking an asylum claim because they think they can have several years of a good life in the US due to the long delays would no longer see that as a viable option, and anyone whose asylum claim is well-founded would get a secure status more quickly. Additionally, allowing immediate legal work for asylum claimants would probably help the solvency of our Social Security system - anyone whose claim is eventually denied would in the meantime be paying into Social Security but would not get to claim benefits.

> If migrants were kept isolated and contained until their asylum application was processed in a reasonable timeframe - let‚Äôs say a few weeks/months - and based on the results, the ones qualified were given immediate asylum and the ones that don‚Äôt immediately deported, I actually wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with this.

Again, why is isolating and containing them at government expense better than letting them work during the processing time for their application to fund their own living costs? We're both on board with shortening the processing time at least, though I would want to be done through staffing up the immigration courts rather than tightening procedural or eligibility constraints beyond all humane limits.",1695400902.0

"""A law can be exploited because it's written in a language. The laws are wrong..."" ""are you saying this thing you've never said?""

""This law is legal but morally wrong. I'm not going to explain how someone fleeing persecution and able to live in a host country should just live in the nearest country, otherwise they're just taking advantage of loopholes""

By your logic, the only asylum claims should be from Mexico and Canada.

It's morally wrong to reject people facing persecution because you personally feel they MUST travel to the nearest nation that's not theirs, otherwise the thing they're literally fleeing from isn't somehow a threat to their life, or freedom.

You've yet to add any good moral argument than just negative criticisms of ""shopping for countries"". Have you ever considered the possibility that the person could speak English? Or they have friends or possible relatives or sponsors in the US?

Ultimately, you sound butthurt that the asylum claim process can be applicable for anyone in the world, while you ignore their valid claims, downplay it, then suggest they're being manipulative for... making choices they can qualify for...

And you complain about morality...

Nah bro, you went on a tangent when someone explained the Asylum process. Even the people who are supposedly against your idea did nothing but force them to not be in the US, legally applicable asylum claim or not.

It's not a loophole for asylum seekers to not be from Mexico or Canada, which is what I and others disagree with you on. 

Look at the comment you first replied to, then look at your response. You quite literally suggest any asylum seeker who had to go through numerous countries isn't a real asylum seeker, but are taking advantage of a legal loophole. 

So even when their claims are applicable, and their reasons in leaving are justified, if they're from another continent and fly past other countries, after applying for asylum in the US, they must be manipulating a loophole? A Loophole that isn't a loophole because asylum claims can be accepted from anywhere that's not the US, given they qualify for acceptance. 

You acknowledge the valid cases and simultaneously judge them if they pass through other countries, even when they applied for asylum in the US, which they are legally and even morally allowed to do. 

To be clear, If this was the interwar period, and Jews trying to flee Germany try to claim asylum in the US, you'd agree with decisions to reject those claims because they didn't apply and try to travel to France or the UK, even though their claim is valid and legal regardless, and literally being the main reason why refugee acceptance has been a thing not just in the US, but globally, for over a century.

"> What are our peer countries? Europe is seeing the largest rise in the far right since WW2 because of immigration.

Yes, the far right is rising in most of the western world right now including the US and Canada as well as Europe. And yes immigration is a big trigger for that, but I'd more say it's because of populist rhetoric/propaganda and some bigotry in response to immigration, as well as underfunding of relevant bureaucracies and support services, rather than directly because of the immigration itself.

As for what are our peer countries, there is a lot of room to argue about the exact list. The strength of my implicit policy comparison varies depending on exactly which scenario you're discussing and which aspect of that scenario you're focusing on. But even comparing the accurate specifics in each such case, including those where the US is doing better as well as those where it's doing worse, would help inform more rational US immigration policy.

One example of where the US is clearly worse than Canada and most of Europe: a Mexican worker with their equivalent of a bachelor's degree (licenciatura) whose profile attracts a skilled worker job offer from a potential employer in the desired destination country, and who wants a better income and/or a safer life than Mexico can offer. Many Mexicans do actually move to the US legally, despite what many right-wingers assume, but many other Mexicans (even educated ones) do come illegally. Let's see why it's so much harder for this scenario to get into the US than into Canada or much of Europe.

First, the situation in peer countries, with a special focus on Canada, Germany, and Spain.

If the destination country is Canada or anywhere in Europe except Ukraine, they can do the job hunt as a tourist without a visa. (Asterisks: T√ºrkiye does require an eVisa for Mexicans but there's no need to visit an embassy or consulate or receive mail from them. Canada does require a usually-easy online pre-approval called an eTA, and the EU will require something called ETIAS next year even for Americans as well as Mexicans, but eTA and ETIAS are similar to the ESTA requirement which US has for Visa Waiver Program countries and are generally far cheaper and easier than visas.)

If the destination country is Canada, skilled work permits are not hard to get, are renewable indefinitely, are open to dual intent even when using the CUSMA exceptions (Canadian name for new NAFTA), give a path toward permanent residence and then citizenship that doesn't inherently require cooperation from the employer and doesn't restrict international travel during processing, offer an open work permit (equivalent to a US EAD) to a spouse, and don't force the worker out of the country before the permit expires if they lose their job or quit. Citizenship can be applied for as soon as 2-3 years after becoming a permanent resident, without needing to rely on any special relationship to a Canadian citizen.

In every EU country except Denmark and Ireland, it's easy for this Mexican skilled worker to get a visa for an EU Blue Card or another skilled worker status, and the spouse can get an that country's equivalent of an open work permit too. There's no need to prove a foreign residence to which one intends to return (i.e. dual intent is allowed), and under most circumstances they would have a statutory right to re-enter Europe during the validity period of their residence permit. The status is renewable indefinitely. offers a path toward permanent residence and then citizenship without cooperation from an employer and without much restriction on international travel during processing. For the EU Blue Card, there is mobility within the participating 25 countries after a year, and self-employment is allowed on the side (under new EU rules which countries by law must implement by this November). In Spain, they can apply for full citizenship in just a couple of years thanks to special provisions for the former Spanish colonies, and of course they already speak the language. In Germany, the EU Blue Card lets them apply for permanent residence (green card equivalent) in 27 months with just a bit of German or in 21 months with a moderate amount of German, or with a regular skilled worker visa this can happen after three years. That moderate level of German also lets them apply for citizenship in 5 years after arriving. (My Germany comments incorporate some legal changes that are already law but not yet in effect and some that the government will pass by the end of this year. They are a pro-immigration coalition government, not right-wing beyond including one libertarian party that honors the libertarian ideals in both social policy and economic policy.)

By contrast, here's the situation for that worker in the US:

Usually, they have no access to a temporary worker visa unless they qualify for a TN or H-1B visa. The TN visa explicitly disallows dual intent, and they can be refused visa issuance or (while uncommon) turned away every time they try to enter due to suspicion of abandoning their foreign residence. There is usually no path to permanent residence or citizenship without cooperation from the employer (or a US citizen or green card-holding spouse). Most paths to permanent residence which do exist add a couple of extra years to the processing time for people born in Mexico just because of their birthplace. If they want to switch to green card status within the US instead of dealing with the horrifically slow backlogs for immigrant visas from the US Consulate in Ciudad Ju√°rez, most worker visa categories need advance permission from the US government to travel internationally. The famous H-1B offers relatively better terms in many of these regards, but is a quota-limited lottery with most qualified applicants rejected due to the quota, and a half-year wait between being selected in the lottery and being able to start work - and it's got a limit of how many years in a row you can hold the status. Most US work statuses don't come with spousal work permission, either, and some of those that do have restrictive eligibilty requirements. Citizenship can't usually happen until 5 years after becoming a permanent resident, or 3 years after permanent residence if living together with a US citizen spouse during that time.

That's quite a lot of differences! And yes, these details are of course different for other categories like unskilled workers, students, and family reunification, but a lot of those comparisons also make the systems in Canada and Europe look good.

And the worst of this is, most Americans have no idea about anything I just said, whether the part about the US or the part about how other countries handle these topics.

"Here is an article from the NYT which is straight forward.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/us/migrant-buses-texas-nyc-los-angeles.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/us/migrant-buses-texas-nyc-los-angeles.html)

""When  a bus packed with migrants pulled into downtown Los Angeles in  mid-June, it caused a local stir: In a city with one of the country‚Äôs  largest immigrant populations, this was the first busload to arrive  courtesy of the Texas governor, Greg Abbott.

This  week, the 12th such bus arrived in Los Angeles, part of the Texas  governor‚Äôs determination to share the responsibility of caring for newly  arrived migrants with Democratic politicians who have supported a more  welcoming national immigration policy.

Both  the Texas governor and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida have offered  migrants free rides from border towns to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia  and several other cities since last year. The arrivals have overwhelmed  some cities, straining shelters and aid resources.

‚ÄúIt  is abhorrent that an American elected official is using human beings as  pawns in his cheap political games,‚Äù Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles [said of the busing program in June](https://mayor.lacity.gov/news/mayor-bass-issues-statement-regarding-arrival-migrants-los-angeles).

But  the reality is that the number of migrants offered free passage from  Texas over the past year is a fraction of those who regularly make their  way from the southern border to cities around the country ‚Äî to places  where there are jobs, family connections and networks of other  immigrants from their homelands. And it has been that way for years.

Of  the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants now living in all 50  states, according to demographers‚Äô estimates, most began their new lives  with a trip from a border city or airport ‚Äî usually paid for by a  relative, an aid group or their own savings, not the Texas governor.

## What was Abbott‚Äôs plan?

Intent  on highlighting the large number of people crossing the border in  recent years, which he blames on the Biden administration‚Äôs immigration  policies, Mr. Abbott devised a plan to approach migrants after they had  been processed by the border authorities and offer them free rides on  chartered buses.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take the border to President Biden,‚Äù he said at a news conference after introducing his plan in April 2022.

Many  migrants have been grateful for the free transportation, because they  often have little money left by the time they complete a monthslong trek  to the U.S.-Mexico border.

Lever  Alejos, a Venezuelan delivered to Washington, D.C., last July, said, ‚ÄúI  feel fortunate the governor put me on a bus to Washington.‚Äù He has  found work and started sending money and gifts to his young son back  home. He recently bought a car.

## Does everyone ride the buses?

No.  In fact, the migrants boarding the Texas-funded buses represent only a  fraction of the thousands arriving at the border each month, and some  migrants are wary of accepting a free ride.

The  Texas busing program has sent about 34,740 migrants to other states  since April of 2022, enough to populate a small city. But that is a  paltry subset of the hundreds of thousands who have crossed the border  during that period, most of whom have probably also made their way to  destinations outside Texas.

New York alone  has received more than 100,000 migrants in the last year; only 13,100  were sent on buses provided by the state of Texas.

What‚Äôs  more, many migrants are crossing the border every day in Arizona,  California, New Mexico and even parts of Texas where no free bus service  is available. After being released by the border authorities, they  typically arrange travel on their own to their U.S. destinations.

Thousands  of immigrants a year take Greyhound buses from Tucson, San Diego and  San Antonio, and some of them take commercial flights, which they can  board as long as they have identification. They pay for the  transportation themselves, or relatives or friends already in the  country buy tickets for them. In some cases, charity groups or  volunteers offer money or mile vouchers for migrant travel.

## Then why is there such a sudden strain on resources in some cities?

Migrants  arriving on the free buses tend to be needier than others. That  reflects a change in the composition of migrants who have been crossing  the border over the past two years. A large share of those riding the  Texas buses are Venezuelans fleeing economic hardship and political  turmoil.

In contrast to Mexicans and  Central Americans, who have been migrating to the United States for  decades, Venezuelans are unlikely to have friends and family members to  receive them because their wave of migration is a new phenomenon.

With  no money and no family, Venezuelans have overwhelmed nonprofit  organizations and volunteer groups since spring last year. Because they  have no connections in the United States, Venezuelans are also more  likely to want to travel to a big city, like New York, where they expect  to find jobs and assistance.

Venezuelans  comprise the majority of migrants staying in homeless shelters in New  York. They continue to arrive, although numbers have dropped in recent  months.

The large numbers of Haitians  arriving recently have also proved taxing for some cities, because many  of them also arrive with few resources of their own.

New  York City and Massachusetts are especially strained by the influx of  migrants because they have right-to-shelter laws requiring the provision  of shelter to people who request it, although in Massachusetts, it  applies only to families with children, and to pregnant women.

## Why are some migrants remaining in homeless shelters for months?

Most  migrants who cross the border are seeking asylum in the United States,  but they are not eligible to apply for work permits until about six  months after they have filed petitions requesting protection. The large  number of applications has also created a backlog.

Without  employment authorization, it is difficult to secure work. Some migrants  find jobs in the informal economy or are paid cash to do blue-collar  work. But even then, it takes time for them to save enough money to rent  a place, and landlords often require proof of income and other  documentation that they do not have.

## What other assistance do the migrants receive?

Families  can receive food, medical care and other assistance, depending on the  state. Children, regardless of immigration status, are entitled to  enroll in public schools everywhere.

For  New York alone, the cost of assisting the migrants is in the billions  of dollars. The financial burden imposed by the newcomers has prompted  leaders in New York, Illinois and Massachusetts to declare states of  emergency, urging the federal government to provide resources.""

So now you have a city, like ours, dealing with statewide issues, without federal aid. 

And because we‚Äôre a dense and walkable city, it‚Äôs easier to see the migrants. Shit, we‚Äôre practically on top of each other and our mothers anyways. So it‚Äôs become a very visible issue, compared to places that were more rural/suburban that could tuck the migrants away out of site.

"Point blank, no matter how welcoming you desire to be or unwelcoming. No matter what side of the political aisle you lean towards, it‚Äôs in your face. NYC does not have the funds or the means to create space for a sudden new population. And, to be fair, I don‚Äôt think any city whether it‚Äôs near the border or far from the border is prepared to suddenly house thousands of people at a moments notice, and know exactly what to do for each one of them.

Yes, some states get more federal funding than others, because they are obviously closer to the border and take in more of the migrants than even we are seeing. We are probably getting a glimpse of something we were tone, deaf to. 

It is putting a very heavy burden on our services that are for the population. That‚Äôs already here.

There‚Äôs a couple of ways to make this work in my opinion. Either increase revenue to the city through heavier taxation which would never be popular with most of us to cover the costs needed. Federally come to the table and agree on immigration, reform, and not allowing excess of an amount that‚Äôs agreed on. The entire world can‚Äôt just flood the gates and we feed them. It‚Äôs just not realistic and we all know it.

The entire world can come here right now, and claim asylum from anything. Obviously what we have is not working and the effects are literally at your feet as you walk down the streets.  There is no sustainable solution that does not involve curbing the amount of migrants that can just walk across the border and get fully funded.

My interpretation- many people are fleeing South America. If they make it across the border to Texas or Florida those governors are busing them up to sanctuary cities.

"The article this comment is derived from is actually really terrible. It misses the two biggest elements creating this crisis: the Expiration of Title 42 and New York‚Äôs status as a ‚Äúsanctuary city‚Äù. 

Title 42 made it so that people seeking asylum had to wait outside of the US while their application is processed. In early May, the Biden Administration let this provision expire with no plan whatsoever. Title 42 held back an estimated 3 million migrants from entering the country since the start of Covid and immediately after its expiration, people were crossing the border at a rate of about 100,000 per day. 

The other issue is that New York has declared itself a ‚ÄúSanctuary City‚Äù. It has vowed to not cooperate with immigration police and has done essentially everything in its power to make the city the #1 destination for migrants up until this point. If you make it here, you will receive free housing, free healthcare and can enroll your kids in school. (New York has the highest cost-per student in the world and it‚Äôs even higher for ESL programs) The City Council even went as far as to pass a law allowing non-citizens to vote, but this was deemed illegal by the courts. (Asylum seekers would be eligible to vote within 6 months of arriving, once they receive approval to work in the city) 

The busing is essentially a political stunt and accounts for 1/10th of the current influx of migrants, at the highest estimation. This is really an issue of lofty good intentions meeting reality. The Biden Administration has essentially adopted an open borders policy through total inaction, because nobody wants to be the bad guy and admit that there has to be a limit to the number of immigrants a country can take on. New York doesn‚Äôt make these federal policies, but it has been of the same mind on immigration up until the chickens came home to roost.",1694332178.0

"This is simply factually incorrect.

The ‚Äòright to shelter‚Äô was never a policy agreed to by any city official. It was never agreed to by the City Council or any Mayor. It was not a referendum and it was never something offered by the City. 

It was *not* voluntary in any way whatsoever. It does not appear in the City charter or legal codes. Seriously, look for it - it doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs purely the outcome of court cases by radical judges.

‚ÄòRight to shelter‚Äô was created through 7 court cases brought by the Coalition for the Homeless on behalf of individuals against the City. I would summarize the cases but the suits and the rulings are very bizarre and obscure. I would say read them but they won‚Äôt make any sense to you - both because they are all using legal jargon to dance around their true intention and because they don‚Äôt make any logical sense.

Each case builds on the last and none of them by themselves are sufficient, but together they forced the City to do something against its will which since it had no choice but to comply had to explain to residents why it had to act in this way. ‚ÄòRight to shelter‚Äô again is not a policy, bill, constitutional provision, electoral referendum. It‚Äôs a requirement forced on the City by a strange series of lawsuits, so the City had no choice except to codify it as a policy.

Neither city politicians nor voters ever had any choice and the Coalition‚Äôs cases were specifically designed to exploit a minor flaw in the constitution to create an obligation by piggybacking off the previous rulings of judges who were clearly biased and helped the Coalition built this artificial structure.

You need to be a lawyer or read a *lot* of commentary on them (like hundreds of pages per case) to even begin to understand how these private lawsuits forced a massive City to adopt an incredibly radical and unusual policy that doesn‚Äôt exist in any other city in the US. Again the decisions seem to emerge from thin air and won‚Äôt make sense if you just try to understand them from a viewpoint of logic & rationality.

There are legitimate concerns about whether the individuals who the Coalition sued the City on behalf of had any real understanding of what the suit entailed, all were approached by the Coalition and encouraged to sue based on very specific circumstances. None had pre-existing suits that the Coalition joined. It was a targeted legal strategy that relied on a couple biased judges.

But because they somehow were able to tie this policy that does not exist in the language of any City executive, legislative, electoral, or constitutional document, the City has no ability to contest the policy and even changing the Constitution might not make a difference bc it doesn‚Äôt exist in the constitution and they would probably find some way to create more legal loopholes.",1694366684.0

"\> Why NOW are there so many migrants coming

Short answer: A bunch of people were waiting at the door and as soon as the door opened they started coming through. 

Longer answer with more background: In 2018, the Trump administration put a new policy in place that forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their applications were processed. Previously, asylum seekers waited in the US. 

In March 2020, in response to the Covid crisis, the Trump administration invokes Title 42; Title 42 gives the federal government the authority to take emergency action to keep communicable diseases out of the country. This stays in place until May 2023.

During this time, the same push factors‚Äîgangs and cartels, poverty, gender-based violence, etc.‚Äîcontinue to fester in South and Central America. Covid makes everything worse. So now you have the people who have been waiting and the additional people coming who have suffered from the way Covid has worsened the political and economic situations. 

Most people are coming on their own, barely any are coming on buses from other states. 

\> Why New York?

Many people have friend or family connections here. It's a big city with name recognition. You can get around without a car, so you don't need to get a car or even driver's license. All government services will have Spanish speakers on staff who can translate for you. There are whole neighborhoods you can go around in all day and never have to speak a word of English. 

\> what services?

Shelter is the big one. To be clear, this isn't the same as housing; these are more like homeless shelters. I've even heard of cots set up in school gyms. After that it's all the usual things humans need‚Äîfood, medical attention. You have social workers helping people with paperwork. Enrolling kids in public schools.

"Thank you, you‚Äôre maybe the only person on this sub who seems to understand that the City was coerced into creating the policy. A consent decree is not something you can just ignore - it‚Äôs a direct order for a city or state to stop violating fundamental civil rights with an enormous range and severity of possible consequences ranging from financial penalties and legal exposure to direct state/federal action to stop the violations.

This can include, at the extreme, occupation of the city by state or federal law enforcement (or even military units), the suspension or even dismissal of electoral officials, and sometimes even fundamental reconstitution of the city‚Äôs political system and institutions to ensure the decree is not violated when the occupation ends and the city regains political autonomy. 

These occupations can theoretically last indefinitely; usually it‚Äôs just a few months at most but in some cases (main cases I‚Äôm thinking of are in Michigan) it has lasted 2-3 years.

Consent decrees have in our lifetime been used almost exclusively for cities that have been incapable or unwilling to address police brutality resulting in the torture and/or illegal killings of black men suspected of crimes. The main example I can think of is when Baltimore had a consent decree issued after the ‚Äòaccidental‚Äô death of Freddie Grey while being transported in the back of a police van in the context of a long and blatant history of racially discriminatory policing, brutality and violations by officers that were ignored, and lack of consequences for police who  clearly and knowingly engaged in criminal behavior. The Justice Department assumed temporary control of the police while it conducted an investigation into civil rights violations and policies/practices that needed to be changed for the police to regain independence. The police resisted enough that feds did remain for a couple months but the elected officials were for the most part supportive so the the government so only the police were taken over by the feds. 

In this case the consent decree was absolutely warranted and these situations are why the mechanism exists. However NYC is the only example I can think of where a court forced a city to implement a radical policy that no other city in the country has and where the decree came from a judge who was essentially a member of an NGO based on cases he had himself ruled on to create new civil rights that the City became in violation of through some really, really weird interpretations. 

Like I really think anybody who wants to be taken seriously in discussions surrounding this law needs to read those cases and see if they can even try to vaguely summarize then and how the City‚Äôs constitution was twisted into things resembling the manifolds of string theory more than a pretzel to make the argument that the City did not understand what it meant when it articulated civil rights of residents and was unknowingly violating a civil right that it didn‚Äôt know it had created but now had to address or face the consequences of systematic civil rights violations.

I‚Äôve put the cases in front of some highly skilled constitutional lawyers familiar with NY state and NYC law and they have been universally baffled. Several have said they are the most incomprehensible, jargon-filled, and just straight up weird case decisions they have read in their lives.",1694387024.0
"By issuing a consent decree, the courts held that NYC would be in violations of civil rights law if it did not establish policies and procedures that would provide shelter to the plaintiffs the Coalition was suing on behalf of AKA anybody within the City‚Äôs borders who asked for shelter. 

A consent decree does not mean the city can decide whether to consent. It means that if it does *not* consent, it is in violation of fundamental civil rights law and is subject to penalties which could include:

-  class action lawsuit for violating ‚Äòcivil rights‚Äô of thousands of individuals for decades, probably necessitating a settlement of billions of dollars
- harsh fines against the City assessed every every day it remains non-compliant
- withholding state and/or federal tax money, program funding, and subsidies until the City complies
- standing for filing tens of thousands of retroactive individual suits against the city for violation of civil rights
- removal of City officials and employees who refuse to implement the decree or attempt to fight it politically
- replacing elected city officials with state-appointed officials who will implement the decree
- nuclear option: appointing an Emergency Manager to implement the decree AKA municipal dictatorship. Emergency Managers can fire any city employee for cause without having to state the cause, hire anybody as an employee for the city, dissolve/merge city agencies, create new city agencies, nullify/modify/create municipal laws and codes, increase or decrease taxes, exercise veto power over every function of every city official (or just remove and refuse to replace them), start/stop/destroy any project, and even sever parts of the City and give them independence or place them under the direct rule of the state
- this is similar to how the state stole the subway from the city under Rockefeller, though it was not necessary to appoint an emergency manager as the City government at that time was so weak and widely considered corrupt that he had enough political support to do it in a less blatantly coercive way. The priorities of an emergency manager are to a) implement the consent decree and crush opposition so that it will be permanent, b) reduce spending as much as possible, and c) reduce the city‚Äôs independence. Emergency managers can do basically whatever they want - they are technocrats who never run for office - and they are hard to get rid of once appointed as they essentially decide whether their task has been completed
- having an emergency manager appointed by the state almost always results in the collapse of a city‚Äôs economy and abject subjection to the state executive & assembly 

The only way the City could have appealed was in the federal courts, but this would be a bad idea:

- first, the court would likely just vacate and defer considering it didn‚Äôt involve federal civil rights law
- second, if the case proceeded and the City lost, it could be subject to a *federal* consent decree
- this allows the Justice department to do what a state emergency manager would do, but with vastly increased scope, power, and rule directly from Washington
- let‚Äôs just say that for example a federal court ruled that the city was in violation of federal civil law and issued a consent decree that City officials and the population opposed.
- Imagine this happens while Trump is in office and the decree is that sanctuary city policies or abortion legality or gender-affirming care in public schools violates federal civil rights. William Barr would be empowered to direct all federal, state, local, and municipal law enforcement agencies to prioritize ending these policies as quickly as possible. 
- This could involve replacing or bypassing City officials and employees, ignoring or changing City laws and practices, and even altering the status of the polity itself (for instance, it might encourage Staten Island to secede and elect a friendly city government that is in accordance with the decree, or it could modify the City borders to grant neighborhoods to Long Island counties. Any protests that interfered could be legally subdued by the NY National Guard, FBI, ICE, DEA, or the US Army. 
- The consent decree would remain in force until the Justice Department was confident that the City would not resume the illegal activity. Under a conservative President, this would probably remain in effect for the duration of their administration as they would argue that NYC would immediately violate civil rights the moment the decree was removed (which would probably be true). In the meantime the government would find all kinds of fun ways to absolutely wreck the city

So the state court held a gun to City‚Äôs head. Did the City draw up a policy that would implement the consent decree to the satisfaction of the courts? Yes. Will you see any reference to a court case in the law itself? No, not unless you read the entire corpus of court decisions that have interpreted the constitution in various ways

Did it do so voluntarily? That *really* depends on what your definition of voluntary means. Were the confessions obtained in Stalin and Mao‚Äôs purges voluntary? I mean, the people did sign them, verbally agree to them, and admitted to treason in open court and to reporters. 

Sure, they were tortured for a couple of weeks or months and threatened with the death or lifelong persecution of their family members, but nobody physically forced their arms to pick up the pens or mechanically controlled their tongues as they admitted their guilt.Obviously this is hyperbolic, but the punitive logic is not really different.

The courts said ‚ÄúDraw up a policy that will address this and implement it or we will cripple the City economically and politically. If necessary we will appoint a dictator who will do so regardless of your opposition. If you want to roll the dice and appeal this at the federal level, know that it likely won‚Äôt work, the consequences if you lose may literally mean the destruction of the City as a political entity, and if it‚Äôs referred back to us we won‚Äôt be as friendly as we are right now.

The current President might be sympathetic to your cause but we are patient, and eventually a President will come along who will gladly reduce you to abject dependence on rule from Washington. So if you have any idea of what‚Äôs good for you and don‚Äôt want to fuck with powers you have no ability to contend with, then draw up a fucking plan, sign the damn paper, and this can all go away.‚Äù

& thus the ‚ÄòRight to Shelter‚Äô became part of the City constitution, though you will not find the phrase in it or in any of the court cases that forced the City to create it. But with enough time and repetition ppl don‚Äôt even bother to look at the history of the thing and most people in the City (especially younger folks) are absolutely 100% *certain* that it‚Äôs stated outright, always existed, and the idea that it *isn‚Äôt* in the constitution is a conspiracy theory.",1694384649.0

"Dude I agree with you. I‚Äôm just explaining why the City created the policy in the first place and why it would need to change its constitution to get rid of it.

Trust me, as a former worker in homeless services this thing has been a major problem for a very long time and everybody working in homeless services who isn‚Äôt making money per client hates it and considers it insane.

The problem is that the public (or at least the segment of the public that controls the city gov, media outlets, and discourse) loves this policy and will be willing to hold onto it even as it drags them down to the bottom of the ocean.

The essence of civil rights law is that the smaller and weaker group needs the government to protect them from the more numerous and stronger group. It‚Äôs a good idea in theory but the problem is that if the weaker group stops engaging in good faith, it can weaponize the body of law against society. 

It‚Äôs a noble ideal, and not one we should give up on. But in NYC you see what it does to society when this is weaponized and exploited to maximum degree - a tiny number of individuals (some of whom are terrible people) are prioritized over the average resident to such a degree that the average person has become a second-class citizen. The City devotes most of its tax revenue to serving a small number of homeless people, fentanyl addicts, criminals who aren‚Äôt sent to prison anymore, and migrants. Meanwhile working and middle class people are absolutely fucked over & over more every month and you‚Äôre very aware that the City truly doesn‚Äôt give a fuck what happens to you.

But if you‚Äôre a migrant - doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, where you‚Äôre from, what you did in your home country, whether you have any even vaguely plausible reason for entering the US - if you‚Äôre not from here, you *have* to be treated better than people from here bc most people are from here. Well, unless you‚Äôre a legal immigrant, in which case you‚Äôre a white-adjacent self-hating person who is a traitor to your people bc you‚Äôre demonstrating that immigration can be done the right way and make all the people who are here for no good reason feel bad.",1694402399.0

"I obviously agree that it‚Äôs one of the most ridiculous judicial oversteps in the past decades and created a time bomb for the City‚Äôs financial health that is exploding right now. But keep in mind the City could have amended its constitution at any point in the decades since and it never did so. 

So for a very large number of New Yorkers this is a feature, not a bug, and it‚Äôs something the public and city officials have refused to discuss changing until now. Iirc there were various reasons that the City decided to stop appealing the decisions:

- it *did* appeal multiple times; the NY Supreme Court declined to take the case and so any future case would occur in front of the same judge who made the ruling in the first place, and every time they went to court the requirements became more extensive
- it didn‚Äôt fully appreciate the existential threat this policy would eventually cause
- the city public was mostly on the side of the judges. Back then it did make more sense, the city was more dangerous and a lot of homeless ppl living in the subways wanted safer places to sleep.
- the pressing issue at the time was how this amount of shelter space could be created in such a short span of time and few were thinking about potential consequences decades later. It was expected that homelessness would remain steady or increase with population, not that it would double or quadruple or become exponential by the month
- nobody expected that border security would be totally abandoned and that the asylum process would be hijacked to create a completely open border without the consent of Congress or the border states
- most border crossing was necessary migrant labor from Mexico for farm work in the southwest and eventually Great Plains and midwestern states; these were guest workers in all but name, came specifically because they knew they could obtain work that would pay for basic housing, and often returned to their families in Mexico with no intention of permanent immigration to the US. 
- These people (whether they moved to the US or not) perform valuable and necessary work, paid taxes, did not expect or require government assistance, and were widely dispersed across the vast farmland of the US rather than concentrated in a single city
- Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban culture all emphasize hard work, the importance of the family, honesty, independence, skepticism of big government, entrepreneurship, etc. This meant that they almost always benefitted the US as immigrants, and like most immigrants to the US they came here for work
- Venezuelan culture emphasizes dependence on the government, living off the profits from oil sales, electing politicians who will hand out everything necessary for life in exchange for votes, victimhood culture, anti-Americanism, avoiding work if at all possible, suppressing opposing viewpoints through mob violence and government censorship, and hatred of business owners and corporations. 
- Unlike past immigrants, they‚Äôre coming here bc they feel entitled to the handouts you get in a socialist society but they ruined their own country, so they looked around for a new source and learned that NYC was handing out hotel rooms, medical care, and education without requiring any work experience or skills and like in Venezuela they will manipulate politics and riot and play the victim card to make sure the  handouts keep coming until all the money is gone
- undocumented immigrants in the past did everything possible to avoid contact with the authorities and did not view welfare programs as an option bc it would attract attention, which made them very frugal and hardworking. The idea that undocumented migrants would purposefully seek out government officials so that they could demand welfare programs allowing them to avoid work was difficult to even imagine.
- the city was already operating the most extensive homeless shelter system in the US and the number of beds that needed to be added at the time was not an unthinkable or crippling number. It was far from trivial but it wasn‚Äôt by itself an insane idea; the insanity was that it was being required to do so by a single judge based on repeated cases brought by an NGO that he had personal and financial ties to
- homelessness hadn‚Äôt yet become a permanent thing based on government printing money to prop up housing prices, restrictions on any new construction of homes, refusal to treat mental illness, viewing IV drug use as a valid lifestyle choice that has to be respected, and viewing even the most depraved violent criminals as  the *real* victims of society who shouldn‚Äôt be held accountable for their actions bc they never had the chance to act differently

Basically while this was caused by true judicial insanity, NYC has had 50+ years to change it and it hasn‚Äôt, so at this point the question is less ‚Äúhow did this policy come to be‚Äù and more ‚Äúwhy do so many people consider it to be a good thing?‚Äù",1694401281.0

If you actually help a person out of homelessness, you lose them as a customer.

Organizations are paid on how many people they can stuff inside their dilapidated buildings, not in any way on how many people they help obtain real housing and/or employment.

DHS is more corrupt than the Trump Organization. It's sad to say but it's true. It's an organized racket to divert huge amounts of money to corrupt politicians and their slumlord friends by using refugees and homeless people to make people think they are martyrs who are doing their best.

Throwing money at a problem is almost never the solution.

The problem is that DHS contracts with nonprofits who make a killing off of extremely temporary overnight shelter with basically no safety or supportive services.

Homeless shelter orgs have no incentive to get people into longer-term housing or help them get jobs because then they would lose a customer.

I worked for one of these 'nonprofits' for several years that has won awards from the City for being an exemplar organization. It is insanely corrupt and unsafe for both clients and staff. The shelter beds are ancient mattresses in crowded rooms. DHS security are completely useless, so NYPD has to come in almost every day. 

People who don't speak English, are physically smaller, or experiencing mental illness are abused by bigger people with extensive criminal histories and violent tendencies. Direct care staff are barely paid above minimum wage, often close to homelessness themselves, almost no benefits, and are blamed and fired for cause if they get assaulted by a client. This leads to burnout and fear, creating an environment lacking in compassion.

I worked in the clinic of this organization (not going to name it bc sad to say it probably is one of the better ones - some shelters are truly, shockingly horrifying places) and everybody I worked with was making $15 or less an hour for jobs that put us under constant verbal abuse and high risk of physical assault. 

When my friend was raped and beaten into a coma by a client they knew had an extensive history of rape and didn't tell us about him, she was immediately fired and denied medical care coverage or workers comp bc she had broken the policy of always having two staff in the mobile van clinics. The other nurse left early and the driver had gone out for 15 min to get something to drink - I never once saw a security officer on any of the vans. 

They never followed these policies, they only had them to fire people who got assaulted. She only got medical expenses covered when her family retained a lawyer who threatened to sue them for a history of breaking this policy regularly and threatening to go to the media about the incident. She got initial expenses paid in return for NDA. Not enough to cover years of physical therapy to walk again and psychiatric treatment to deal with the trauma.

Meanwhile the medical director (who did almost literally nothing) was making $600K and executive level mgmt all closer to a million. Most of the shelter buildings were owned by the CEO through a shell corp and the nonprofit leased the land and buildings from his fake company at rates far above market value. We calculated that he was probably making about $10 million/year",1678256519.0

Please read this article, because if you think that's the take-away, you are absolutely mistaken.

"You‚Äôre very much right in that NYC‚Äôs situation is just the most visible aspect of a much, much wider problem. 

Some are our direct fault - for example:

- Refugees related to DEA activity in Central and South America that caused societies and economies to collapse due to violence, leading to huge refugee populations 
- US businesses too dependent on migrant labor to function and relying on undocumented to lower labor costs/prevent unionization and fair/safe workplaces
- Legal immigration system is stupidly restrictive, slow, expensive, and difficult even though most American scientific and technological progress have been made by immigrants and immigration is one of our society‚Äôs greatest strengths. No guest worker program.

Some are not our fault:

- Failure of ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù governments (Cuba, Venezuela, El Salvador) to provide basic civil rights and economic opportunities for their citizens, leading to state collapse, famine, mass killings, et
- Climate change and natural disasters
- Failure of Mexico to control their side of the border bc of extensive government corruption by the cartels and the knowledge they can turn their refugee problem into a U.S. refugee problem by quickly moving people through Mexico

But NYC makes itself a mark. The City can‚Äôt solve these national problems, and it‚Äôs killing itself in attempts to try.

- letting other state bus migrants directly to the city without any attempt to interdict these buses
- right to shelter draws people from all over the country
- police tolerance of non-violent criminal activity is a huge problem for quality of life, businesses, and safety
- spending more money on refugees than on people who have been living and struggling in NYC for years 
- not targeting corruption and accepting it as a necessary evil
- ignoring the obvious roles that mental illness and/or addiction play for some people without housing
- fighting against any attempt to regulate immigration

The last is the one that is the biggest issue. 
- we don‚Äôt know how many people cross the border every year
- many people pay to be smuggled by the cartels, they are often abused and occasionally killed
- there is obviously massive drug and weapons trafficking across the border
- we need a migrant labor system to fill the economic roles we need immigrants for, and ideally the opportunity for green card for people who have been living in US + paying taxes + no crimes for more than a year or two
- people should not be allowed to cross the border without determining whether they are actually refugees and not economic migrants
- it is not a universal human right to move to a country where you will make more money
- the border on both sides has become a violent, almost lawless place, where the cartels and the Border police both use brutality and ruthlessness to control local populations
- the ability to sneak across the border makes legal immigrants feel like marks. By trying to do the right thing they get screwed over. We need to make it *much* easier to immigrate legally and much harder to do so illegally. 
- A country needs to have control over its borders for very basic reasons of security and information. Mexico needs to take responsibility for many of these people, and the left-wing authoritarian governments need to be overthrown so their economies can recover and people can go home

You absolutely can not get rid of due process just because ""most"" of the time it goes one way, that is insane.

US currently has about a 68% conviction rate on felonies, and a 63% rate of asylum rejection.

And since it isn't they jump through all kinds of hoops to try to explain why that is. I saw a bunch of people on here the other day blaming Staten Island for Adams getting elected. Not only could Staten Island, which constitutes like 7% of the City's population, never even come close to single-handedly electing a Mayor, but it was also the only borough Adams lost in the general election (he won the Democrat primary on Staten Island but he did so by winning low-income Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, much like he did in the other boroughs). But it's a comforting thought for them that all their political woes are the fault of a borough they never go to rather than the ones they like to pretend are some leftist utopia. 

In reality though, NYC just isn't THAT progressive. It's heavily Democratic but even that is a relatively new thing. Like the last ten or so years (which, to be fair, is 2-3x longer than most of them have lived here).

No, they are just invading and most of them are here for economic opportunities. Also migrants are being moved to a location near me which is going to make the overall area worse.  This is just an invasion and it will also likely to cause more and more people to turn away from more moderate views and liberal views as we aren't taking enough action. You might be an immigrant lover but your quickly becoming the minority if you aren't already. NYC as a whole do not want them here at least in such mass numbers.

"Transplants are disconnected from native NYC. So many are affluent, privileged, and insulated from the experiences of the average New Yorker. That's how they're able to move here given the high price of admission into the city.


Another difference I've noticed between transplants and native New Yorkers is their views on crime. Native New Yorkers are much more worried about it and prefer a ""tough on crime"" approach, while the transplants somehow think crime is a cute quirk of ""big city living"" and anybody against crime is a right-winger Karen. I legitimately saw a post on social media by a transplant in NYC from Oklahoma who said she moved here for her kids to experience ""diversity"", and so is dismayed at her native New Yorker neighbors who had posted about growing sex work and open drug use in her neighborhood, with photos included. She said she hoped her neighbors would be more ""open minded"",  and thinks they're assholes who are exaggerating and stupidly believing right-wing ""lies."" I see the same thing happening in other cities like SF - these transplants from suburbs and middle America thinking crime and terrible safety are cute and quirky ""big city"" things that everyone should love instead of hate. IDK, I'm a transplant (from MANY years ago, and with no money) and a progressive, but over the years, I've come to really despise these wealthy transplants whose money protects them from everything the rest of us have to deal with.",1694311223.0

"Yeah, I've also noticed stuff like that. It also feels like some of them downplay crime because NYC being ""the safest big city in the country"" or whatever Bloomberg used to push is part of their idealistic view of NYC. It's like they have some checklist in their mind of what NYC has to be in order for them to be able to justify living here (and probably to make bragging to their friends back home more convenient).

It's gotta be super progressive. Super safe, but also gritty. Bougie but also have an ""energy."" Lively and crowded but not to the extent that it disturbs them or else they're gonna call the police or 311 to complain about the ice cream truck song or people playing music too loudly or any of the two dozen other mundane things I've seen them complain about on here. 

That extreme level of entitlement is really what rubs most native New Yorkers the wrong way I think. And a lot of it likely does come from their economic status. They grow up privileged in the suburbs getting everything handed to them and they genuinely cannot fathom why the entire City didn't also start bending to their every whim the second they moved in. They're like the full embodiment of that meme about people having ""main character syndrome."" They really don't even see a NYC outside of Manhattan and the select handful of neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens that them and their transplant comrades have colonized. And they view those areas that they've lived in for like five minutes as places that should be entirely under their control. It's basically all occupied territory at this point. 

With that said, plenty of transplants are cool. One of my favorite people on Earth is a 60-year old far-left white dude who moved to NYC in the 80s from suburban Ohio.

"Will Work Permits Fix New York‚Äôs Migrant Crisis?

archive.md

Under the policy change announced last week, Venezuelans who arrived in the U.S. by July 31 will be eligible for a program known as Temporary Protected Status or TPS. It offers them deportation protections and the ability to work legally for at least 18 months.

But TPS might not prove the silver bullet New York was hoping for. Before this latest announcement, other applicants for TPS were waiting an average of 12 months to be granted their status and accompanying work permits, federal data show, raising the prospect of idle months before migrants can take advantage of the latest move. And though Venezuelans make up the largest contingent of migrants heading for New York, only about a quarter of the 60,000 currently in the city‚Äôs shelter system are Venezuelan, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams‚Äôs office confirmed.

Federal and state officials are also worried that the announcement of work permits could itself act as a draw for more migrants to cross the border illegally‚Äîand head for New York. That concern magnified in recent days when, just as officials were announcing the new program, a crush of Venezuelan migrants crossed all at once into the¬†tiny Texas border town of Eagle Pass, stretching that city‚Äôs processing and shelter capacity to a breaking point. Eagle Pass is also one of the pickup locations of the free buses that Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott runs¬†between the border and New York.

Surge of Migrants Put Strain on Texas City

A further surge was Biden administration officials‚Äô precise fear when, month after month, they rebuffed¬†requests from Adams, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and other blue-state Democrats. Behind closed doors, the administration delivered the message: What you are asking for will only make the problem worse.

So the blue-state Democrats made their pleas increasingly public. Adams held a campaign-style rally last month where he featured several asylum seekers as speakers and implored the federal government with a chant: ‚ÄúLet them work!‚Äù

More than 100 members of Congress signed onto letters urging the move, and financial leaders including ‚Äôs Jamie Dimon and Google‚Äôs Sundar Pichai lobbied the White House.

Hochul paid the White House multiple visits but couldn‚Äôt secure a commitment. She kept up the pressure: in private meetings with senior White House aides, which the governor has described as ‚Äúloud,‚Äù and in a speech from the state capitol criticizing the administration.

‚ÄúWe heard you,‚Äù Biden ultimately whispered in Hochul‚Äôs ear ahead of the announcement, according to the governor, when they both attended a reception for the United Nations General Assembly at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

By Thursday, Biden was touting the decision in a speech at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute to loud cheers.

Critics of both New York and the Biden administration say their singular focus on work permits as a solution has allowed Democrats to skirt the thornier issue of calling for harsher border policies that would slow or even stop the flow of migrants heading to the U.S.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear the Democrats saying anything about stopping the flow by securing the border,‚Äù said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican representing Staten Island.

The work-permit news came as a welcome surprise to Beisys Romero Herrera, a 33-year-old Venezuelan woman who arrived in New York with her four boys a little under a year ago. They now live in a hotel-turned-shelter on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

Romero has been taking the occasional cleaning job and just recently bought an e-bike on credit from a neighbor, which she has been using to make food deliveries around the city, one of her children usually in tow. But the pay, about $100 a day so far, isn‚Äôt enough for Romero to move out of the shelter‚Äîand in any case most landlords won‚Äôt rent to her without a work permit.

Since April 2022, New York has received more than 115,000 migrants at its arrivals center in Midtown Manhattan looking for help. The resulting crisis has cost the city $2 billion so far, the mayor has said, and the federal government has only reimbursed a fraction of that cost. The Biden administration now says it needs Congress to authorize more funds before it can send New York or other cities more money.

That is how local officials became fixated on work permits as a solution. If migrants could immediately find above-the-board work‚Äîplugging existing labor shortages in industries such as hospitality‚Äîthey could move out of city-run shelters, relieving some of the financial strain.

The problem with their initial request, to expedite work permits for all asylum seekers, is that it is against the law. Under the existing process, migrants must first apply for asylum, a time-consuming process that most often requires help from a lawyer or advocate, and then wait an additional six months for a work permit. Advocates estimate that asylum seekers newly arriving in the U.S. should expect to wait a year or longer before they receive work authorization from the federal government.

That is why officials next focused on TPS as their best hope. When the government designates a country for TPS, meaning conditions are so dangerous there that its citizens can‚Äôt safely return home, the move automatically offers recipients work permits that can‚Äôt be challenged in court.

Department of Homeland Security officials have privately assured New York City that they hope to issue work permits to Venezuelans in a matter of weeks rather than months, according to federal and state officials familiar with the conversations, though they weren‚Äôt confident enough to make a public commitment to be speedy.

Now that they have gotten what they asked for, New York officials are realizing they still need a lot more help. They are lobbying the Biden administration to consider designating other countries for TPS, though no one country would have as much of an impact as Venezuela.

They have asked the White House to consider granting migrants humanitarian parole, another quasi-legal status that comes with a work permit. The administration has been granting the status for migrants who come through a legal path to the U.S., such as via an appointment at the border, but not for those who cross the border illegally.

Beisys Romero Herrera brought along her son Angelo, 10, to make food deliveries around the city earlier this month.¬†Photo:¬†Oscar Durand for The Wall Street Journal

And they have asked the administration to consider a more concerted resettlement strategy. Instead of allowing migrants to travel wherever they would like, overwhelmed city officials want the White House to actively pick destinations to spread them out across the country.

Mayling Martinez RaFermis Freites, a Venezuelan who arrived with her family in July, said she definitely plans to apply for TPS‚Äîit will be easier than putting in an application for asylum‚Äîbut said she doesn‚Äôt know how yet. Since coming to New York, Martinez said she hasn‚Äôt been able to find steady work that pays enough to also cover a babysitter.

‚ÄúIt will make things better, for sure, to be able to look for work,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to always live off the government in a hotel.‚Äù

There are certainly racists out there, but then there are also ordinary taxpayers like me who want to know what the plan is longer-term.

I‚Äôm not against work authorization and taking care of those who are here while the asylum process plays out, but there needs to be a corresponding serious, specific conversation about what our limit is as a city/ state/ country (we‚Äôre at 100K+ in a year; is it 300K, 400K, infinite?); how to expedite the asylum process to distinguish valid/ invalid claims more quickly; and how to stem the current flow so there isn‚Äôt this chaotic mass influx.

> The only difference between them and the millions of migrants that came here in the 19th century is their race.

I‚Äôd argue the difference that actually matters is our guarantees to today‚Äôs migrants - food, shelter, medical care, counseling, education, etc. All of which I‚Äôm glad we now provide - but, given the generosity of our safety net, it should be reserved for valid asylum seekers and on our own terms as a city/ state/ country.",1695684331.0

so if they remove right to shelter does that mean everyone gets kicked out of their hotels or wherever the government is housing them then they become homeless and add to that crisis? or is it only for new immigrant people who aren't already sheltered by nyc but if they come here will they be sent to another city or just be homeless?,1696510265.0

"From the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/04/nyregion/eric-adams-right-to-shelter-migrant-crisis.html):

>In a [letter](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/press-releases/2023/2023.10.03%20-%20Callahan%20v.%20Carey%20-%20City%27s%20Letter%20Application.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery) to Erika Edwards, a New York Supreme Court justice, the city‚Äôs lawyers asked for the 1981 consent decree that requires the city to provide shelter to be temporarily suspended. They also asked for the rules to be suspended whenever the governor or mayor declares a state of emergency and there is an influx of people seeking shelter.

So they're trying to get the NY Supreme Court to clarify their ruling, and allow the mayor to disregard the right to shelter with a state of emergency decree. They're entirely at the mercy of the court ‚Äî but this plan feels sorta dangerous to me, depending on the wording. Imagine a storm hitting NYC, mayor declares a state of emergency, and *shuts down shelters*. And how will we define how many migrants is too many migrants? It could in practice give the mayor the power to indefinitely disregard the right to shelter.",1696512148.0

"Since the governors of Texas and Florida began sending migrants northward in acts of political theater last spring, the city of New York has received close to 44,000 asylum seekers, a number greater than the populations of SoHo and TriBeCa combined. According to City Hall, there have been 12,000 new arrivals during the past month alone. While New York has welcomed great numbers of immigrants into its ecosystem each year for centuries ‚Äî there are more than three million foreign-born people living in the city now, responsible for close to a quarter of the city‚Äôs gross domestic product ‚Äî it has not confronted a situation where so many people have come in such rapid sequence without the traditional pathways to integration.

Typically, someone moving to the city from the Dominican Republic or West Africa might land with connections to a church group, or to friends and family already established here; there is likely a network that can connect you to a job and a room in a crowded basement apartment in Queens or the Bronx. But so many have arrived here by perverse happenstance in recent months. Whether they have ended up in New York against their will or because of departures made in desperation and haste ‚Äî they are without the sort of plans accompanying a more deliberate resettlement.

This is unprecedented territory. The fact of more than 40,000 immigrants coming to the city over a short stretch of time is not the problem, as one city official put it to me, it is that so many are entering the already burdened shelter system at once.

The depth and severity of the crisis, unfolding in the midst of the city‚Äôs housing emergencies, cannot be overstated ‚Äî it is as if two natural disasters were occurring simultaneously. When Eric Adams took office as mayor in January last year, before the influx of migrants from the border began, there were roughly 45,000 people in the shelter system; that figure has since grown by 71 percent to 77,000. Beyond its sheer scope, the migrant crisis is remarkable for its relative obscurity to so many New Yorkers, who encounter homelessness in their daily lives with uncomfortable regularity, but who have not had as much direct experience with the latest wave of immigrants.

The issue registered more obviously in recent days, as the city has come under fire for a decision to move several hundred people from a Midtown hotel, where it has been housing asylum seekers, to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, a 180,000-square-foot building on the Red Hook waterfront. The idea was to prioritize hotel space for families with children by moving single men into a congregate setting, a practice the city observes with its shelter system more broadly. The terminal was sitting vacant and would not have returned to its official use until cruise ship season began again in the spring.

Activists quickly objected, citing similarities to a ‚Äúdetention center‚Äù; the city blamed them for riling up occupants of the hotel slated for relocation, some of whom slept outside in protest rather than move to the new relief center until the police swept the encampment on Wednesday night. The terminal had 1,000 cots available, one next to the other, an efficient use of space that afforded no privacy. Dividers, the city comptroller, Brad Lander imagined, would be hard to incorporate, simply because the cots are placed so close together that it would be impossible to move around the bed within such an enclosure.

But the ongoing housing catastrophes have put the city in a constant mode of triage and improvisation. Relying on hotels is neither ideal nor economically logical, but actual shelter space is almost impossibly constrained. In September the city reported that the length of stay for a family with children in shelters had increased to an average of 534 days during the 2022 fiscal year, up from 520 days the previous year and 414 days in 2017. In a different scenario, there would be a great outward flow from the system leaving it free to accommodate new entrants. The city has already opened 82 emergency shelters since asylum seekers began to arrive and enabled the conversion of four large hotels into relief centers. To build a new shelter takes an average of two years.

While the city has not allowed members of the press to enter the Red Hook facility, on Wednesday afternoon it began offering tours to various political officials in an effort to quiet the noise. Among the first visitors were Brooklyn‚Äôs borough president, Antonio Reynoso, and several members of the City Council who spoke to a tiny group of reporters when they made their way out. They noted that, contrary to early claims, the building was in fact warm, though the men staying there had to walk outside to take showers in mobile units, because propane heating units could not be installed in the terminal itself.
Councilwoman Shahana Hanif was the first to express a concern about the lack of privacy, and she and her colleagues wished that the administration had done more to allay the anxieties of men who were not sure what the Red Hook move would mean. After so many of them had experienced so much trauma in their long treks, often by foot to the border, they harbored a reasonable fear that they were being taken to a place from which they would eventually be deported. But the facility was safe, Mr. Reynoso said. There had been no reports of the kinds of crime that plague men‚Äôs shelters and often serve as a deterrent to sleeping in them.

On the same day, Gov. Kathy Hochul allotted $1 billion in the state budget for the migrant crisis. Mr. Lander pointed out that while that was an undeniable positive, the federal immigration system needed to speed up work authorizations, the processing of which has been significantly backlogged. ‚ÄúThese are largely a group of folks who want to work,‚Äù he told me. They cannot do that without the proper paperwork.

But even immediate access to jobs will not necessarily segue into housing solutions. ‚ÄúNew York City has already done more than nearly any other city in the nation to support this influx of asylum seekers, but our resources are limited, and we need support,‚Äù Fabien Levy, a spokesman for the mayor‚Äôs office, wrote in an email. ‚ÄúIf corrective measures are not taken soon, we may very well be forced to cut or curtail programs New Yorkers rely on. These are not choices we want to make, but they may become necessary, and we must be honest with New Yorkers about what we‚Äôre facing.‚Äù",1675629181.0
"Of course not, entire states (without ongoing housing crises) don't have the resources to deal with the the full scope of the problem and NYC does more than it's share. 

But Texas and Florida don't want NYC to do just more than its share, they want NYC to fail just so they can go ""haha told you so"". That's why the migrants were sent with no co-ordination or planning with local resources. They explicitly want to hurt the city and minimize NYC's chances of dealing with this.",1675684923.0

I would skip the Central Park Zoo and replace it with the Bronx Zoo. CPZ is bland, small, and not worth it.

"Not going to comment on the migrant situation as other have already told you how ridiculous your comment is.  Keep in mind 8+ million people live and work here, and over 60+ million will be visiting this year.  Tell your sister and her friend to stuff it.

Some suggestions:

Swap out the Bronx Zoo instead of Central Park Zoo

Botanical Gardens (assuming you mean Bronx) is beautiful but do you want to go to Bronx twice?  A walk through Central Park will be just as nice.  Be sure to check out the many playgrounds for your kids to run around and be kids.

Will your kids be able to sit through the Lion King?  Perhaps consider the [Gazillion Bubble Show](https://gazillionbubbleshow.com).

You have three observation decks listed.  No need for that.  Pick one (I recommend the Top of the Rock)

Little Italy is just a tourist street with restaurants.  Not really anything to do; definitely head to Chinatown though.

Staten Island Ferry - one of my favorite things to do.  There's a great playground (Playscape) in Battery Park, definitely worth a visit.

I can't imagine that kids will be interested in the NYPL.  Take a trip out to Queens instead and go to the NY Hall of Science?",1724332921.0
"Sorry, but your sister is a fear monger and over exaggerating. Just be aware on the subways. Most crimes are happening there. $300/day is plenty. Download US editions of Yelp and Google apps and keyword search for lunch specials, prix fixe dinner specials and happy hours for deals in the areas you'll be in.  Maybe I'd add The Color Factory?",1724304262.0
"Don't worry about migrants.  You will probably see troubled and scary-looking people.  Ignore them and you'll be fine. Trust your gut.  With little kids, I think your concerns are likely to be 1) exhaustion from walking way more than you're used to and 2) finding bathrooms.  I don't have kids, but have hosted several friends with little ones.

As you plan your itinerary, look carefully at the map to be see how far you will be walking. Important for everyone, but especially small children.  You can easily rack up 2-4 miles on a normal NYC day.  Make sure the whole family has comfortable, sturdy shoes. Bring a stroller.  

Public restrooms can be hard to find in NYC. Download one of the apps that shows restroom locations. 

You're getting recommendations based on adult sensibilities.  For young children, I suggest the Central Park Zoo and Brooklyn Botanic Garden because they are smaller and don't involve a long trip.

"I hate the way the comments here are so condescending. 

Breakfast: Look for a diner or unpretentious restaurant near the hotel. Best to find it the night before or ask for advice at the hotel. Some are cheap. Others are not. Look inside and see if there are other children in there.

Lunch and dinner: my priority would be child-friendly places over better food. A pizza place with lots of seating is ideal. Don‚Äôt try to find the best pizza. Just a place where your kids can hang out easily. If you get bored with pizza, a deli with lots of seating is an alternative. Or Shake Shack for hamburgers. Google ‚Äúchild friendly restaurants NYC‚Äù for other suggestions. 

Places to go: My vote is for the Central Park Zoo. It‚Äôs small but about the right size for 5 year olds. Unless your kids are able to do a lot of walking and appreciate variety. Then the Bronx Zoo is worth visiting. The Children‚Äôs Museum is decent. Central Park has fantastic playgrounds. Google to find the best ones.

As you know, your kids are likely to get very tired doing too many things. It‚Äôs good to find places where they can just sit and rest. I recall that the Museum of Natural History had a big room, known as the whale room, where both parents and children could sit on the floor to rest but the kids could also walk around if they wanted. Another good place is the shopping mall at Hudson Yards as well as the plaza outside of it. There are tables and chairs where you all can just relax and do nothing. 

I also recommend doing only a few things that are close to each other each day. A good way to travel is by bus. It‚Äôs slower but your kids will enjoy seeing things out the window. Subways are also fun. My recommendation is to do at at most two long trips per day, but otherwise do things that are close to each other. Don‚Äôt be too ambitious.

If you happen to be in the UWS, a nice restaurant is Bustan, especially if you can get a table in the garden. It has very good Mediterranean food, is a little fancy but, based on a recent visit, exceptionally child friendly for a restaurant that nice. 

A less fancy but child friendly is Carmine‚Äôs.

To be honest, if all you do is ride the bus around, eat pancakes, pizza and hamburgers, and go to playgrounds, your kids will have a blast.",1724346937.0

There‚Äôs just no evidence for claims New York has a high crime rate, especially not because of ‚Äúmigrants‚Äù. It‚Äôs just pure nonsense. I‚Äôve never even been a victim of a pickpocket here. The only ‚Äúmigrants‚Äù I encountered today were the incredibly nice guy who delivered my dinner and the construction workers who waved at me and my newborn walking down the street. Didn‚Äôt get a chance to check their documents since they were too busy being decent hardworking people.

The Botanical Garden in the Bronx is the one to go to. Don‚Äôt bother with the one in Brooklyn.

The Bronx Zoo is the better zoo but Central Park is an incredible place to be in the summer. The zoo is fine if you want to do both.

Museum of Mathematics is okay. I‚Äôm a math nerd and it felt a little too ‚Äúexit through the gift shop‚Äù for me. But it‚Äôs right on Madison Square Park which is a great spot and has the original Shake Shack in it.

I would skip Little Italy. It‚Äôs just a few tourist traps selling overpriced low quality Italian food in a city with a lot of good Italian food. Better to go to Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, but it‚Äôs not super convenient on the train.",1724312557.0
Real New Yorkers avoid Times Square because it's a tourist hell hole. Port Authority is just a normal hell hole,1724308215.0
"Other than shows, we don't usually go to Times Square. That said, if you have never been here, have kids and have never seen it- I think it's worth a visit.

Just avoid the scams like the character figures- dont take pics with them, theyll charge you an arm and a leg for them after the fact. Generally that's the most dangerous part of Time's Square I've ever dealt with.",1724345321.0

"the only time i ever have any sort of run in with migrants is when they are on the train selling candy. im sure among the people that come to this country are some criminals, gang members, whatever, but 99.99% of migrants are just normal people living their lives just as i‚Äôm living mine. media blows it waaaaaaaay out of proportion.",1715205971.0
"It's not as bad, but there are problems. I think a lot of people who are saying that nothing is wrong are a) rich b) men or c) live in Brooklyn. I live in the city and I'm a woman. I can safely say that catcalling/harassment/being cursed at for ignoring them/threatened/stalking has gotten a lot worse in just this year alone. 

Yes, NYC has always had these problems like any big city does, but it has never been this bad in my lifetime. The reality that no one wants to say out loud is that many of these migrants are from parts of the world that think The Handmaid's Tale looks like a great idea. Yes, I know many Republicans are the same way, but I don't see them smoking outside of hotels and calling women bitches for ignoring their sexual slurs. Out of sight, out of mind I guess.

That being said, it's not all doom and gloom. Some migrants I've met from China were really great. Very polite and seemed eager to work. I like seeing migrants who are selling things like candy and fruit because I appreciate that they are trying to earn an honest wage. That kind of hustle deserves respect. 

In other words, it's not as bad as it appears on TV. Some migrants are actually trying to work and are happy to be here. Others do nothing but smoke, drink, harass women, and demand more when they've already been given more than most of my neighbors who are working three jobs just to scrape by. 

The city has gotten worse since 2018 when we had the lowest crime rate on record. A lot of businesses are shutting down due to constant theft. Stealing phones and assaulting women has become a big thing now. My gay friends don't feel safe going out in certain neighborhoods at night anymore. But, the world still spins, we still go to work, the city is not on (complete) fire. There is a problem. It's just a problem you notice--and are more honest about--if you don't have rich parents paying for an apartment in a nice area where you can ignore these problems.",1720342564.0

"If you say it effects your life you get a down vote.  The only affordable hotel in Manhattan close to my friends is now a shelter.  NYC civil servants had a hiring freeze.  The budget for the migrants is greater than NYC parks, fire department, and sanitation combined.  Certain areas are overrun with scooters with no insurance or plates.  I almost got into a car accident on the belt parkway because a migrant was riding his bicycle on the highway.  I don't blame the migrants, they had an opportunity and took it.  I do blame the people in charge for letting this happen.  NYC has it's own problems and shouldn't of taken on more.",1715291698.0
I'm born and raised in NYC and it's definitely super noticeable. Anyone who says they don't see the migrants around is either in denial or don't recognize who is a migrant and who is not. There is a migrant shelter in LIC around the Hunters Point station on the 7 line and biking past them is honestly scary. They are spread out for blocks around the neighborhood just sitting around doing nothing. Was in Grand Central area the other day too and the number of migrants sitting outside is just honestly embarrassing. Saw some Hispanic women with their small children sitting on the floor begging for money a few times too. It really is a crisis.,1721140229.0

"I work in NYC schools.  We've had more than 75 students join our small school. They are respectful, kind, and eager to learn for the most part. But, some of these teens are also like TEENS very counterculture, unmotivated, depressed, homesick, etc... It's not a hell hole, and it's not a panacea. But, it's different. 
On a negative note, I went to see Hell's Kitchen this week, and there were dozens of migrant men smoking copious amounts of drugs, looking undesirable and simply standing on the corner. They made me feel uncomfortable ang so I put away my phone. As there have been many reports of phones being stolen.  
When I left around 10-11 at night, I was SHOCKED to see that many women, school-aged children, and babies were out on the block with the men.  It was a school night!  The children should have been in bed.  This type of behavior is extremely irresponsible and makes you question if they're here for a better future?",1716660790.0
"Yup.  Ignore all of these gaslighting comments.  They live in their own luxury high rise bubble.  There has a been a huge uptick in robberies, especially on scooters.  A migrant just shot at 2 cops in queens.  Another migrant in the bronx killed 2 residents.  It's gonna be a hot summer no doubt.

"There is no way to tell if someone's a migrant or if they are a latino person who is a citizen who has lived here all their lives. I accidentally ran into a youtube channel that the entire channel of hundreds of videos was someone recording latino people selling fruit and walking around the subways and sidewalks, and it seemed completely normal to me. Like yes, this is what it looks like here, tons and tons of latin looking people doing the same shit they've been doing for decades: selling fruit, churros, and candy and going to work and shit. Apparently after looking at the accompanying text, all this sheer amount of video was ""evidence"" of how many migrants where filling nyc and making it into a third world country. How the fuck are you supposed to tell the difference between a long time resident/citizen and a migrant? And when did selling churros become a new problem here? It's been going on since a lot of us were kids and even longer than that. But that's the kind of person, who are definitely racists, who's saying NYC is filled with disgusting migrants who are destroying america. The only thing I have noticed is there are more kids selling candy on the subway. But then, that's been happening since before this migrant thing, but before it was black kids selling candy for their ""basketball team"".

... what I can't take is ALL OF THAT combined and then to pay through the roof due to half the hotels being filled with migrants (lack of competition from the other hotels on pricing) and the crashed economy charging 2-3 x the prices for food etc ON TOP of all the above.

Manhattan has a problem if I, one of the biggest fans of the place who has walked hours around it many times, in the past feeling perfectly safe, now has pause for thought and to the point I'm cancelling trips partly due to not wishing to inflict the risk of the TDA migrant gangs on myself but also not to reward further or 'vote' if you will for the way NYC is going with this continued self inflicted madness of sanctuary city combined with ever slack laws and police defunding.",1729512172.0

It will overstrain  our infastructure and then soon everyone will suffer including us residents. and it's already starting to happen within hospitals . The city it's now cutting vital services to residents including firing police officers.,1704161598.0
